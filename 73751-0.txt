PREFACE TO THE COLOSSEUM.


The great excavations carried on in this colossal building in the years
1874 and 1875, have thrown an entirely new light on its history. These
were made under the level of the ground, at the foot of the _podium_,
which is the same as that of the original _arena_; this large level space
had been indifferently called the ground, the floor, the stage, the
area, or the arena; no one had any idea that the original pavement would
be found 21 ft. below that level, and that the intervening space was
filled with walls and passages, dens for wild beasts, places for lifts
to send up men, and dogs, and animals: and canals for water, and several
other contrivances for the use of the performers on the stage above, for
practically the _arena_ was the stage on which the performances took
place. These excavations have enabled us to ascertain that this had been
a boarded floor covered with sand, or _arena_ (whence its name), and
that this floor could be moved and replaced in a short time, at the word
of the Emperor[1]. The evidence of this is brought out clearly in the
present work. Large corbels, or brackets, are provided for placing the
boards upon when removed, and keeping them out of sight of the people
in the galleries; they project from the wall below the _podium_, in the
passage over the dens[2].

We had all of us hitherto been taught that this enormous structure
had been all built in ten years by the Flavian emperors; this is the
uniform modern history, but no ancient author says so. It is only one
of the so-called “Roman Traditions,” which (as I am obliged to repeat
continually) are nothing but the _conjectures_ of learned men during
the last three centuries, especially Panvinius and his school in the
seventeenth. In the present instance it is evident that so far from
having been all built in ten years, it was more than a century about from
first to last; it was begun in the time of Sylla the Dictator, by his
step-son Scaurus, and is described by Pliny in his “Natural History” by
the name of the _insane_ work of Scaurus, who was called insane because
he spent such an enormous fortune upon the work, (equal to more than
two millions sterling of modern money). It is true that Pliny calls it
a _theatre_ and not an _amphitheatre_, and this has deceived scholars,
who do not perceive that the two names were used quite indifferently
at that period. Pliny himself contrasts it with the great _theatre_ of
Pompey, built long afterwards, and when the city had increased so much,
yet which only held 40,000 people, while this building would hold 80,000.
There is no other site in Rome where 80,000 people could be placed to see
a show excepting this and the Circus Maximus, which is never called a
theatre. An inscription has been found in the _amphitheatre_ itself, in
which it is called _theatrum_ and not amphitheatrum, which is still _a
theatre_, though it has two round ends to it, instead of one being flat.
The celebrated Greek theatre at Taormina, in Sicily, which has the most
perfect _scena_ that is known anywhere, is still called by the people
either theatre or amphitheatre indifferently, as I was told by the local
guide on the spot, in May, 1876. Either a theatre or an amphitheatre was
a place of public amusement.

This great building of Scaurus was three storeys high. On the level of
the ground were marble columns by the hundred, on the first floor glass
columns (the only instance on record), on the upper floor they were of
gilt wood. Pliny says that part of this insane work was only calculated
to be of a _temporary_ character, and it was in fact all destroyed by
fire a few years afterwards, and the glass columns perished equally with
those of gilt wood; he also adds that other parts were calculated to be
_eternal_, and this equally applies to the part we have remaining, the
great substructures, which being underground, and built of large blocks
of tufa, would last as long as the hills if let alone. Many of these
great blocks of tufa appear to have been used a second time; they were
most probably brought from the second wall of Rome, which enclosed the
two hills (the Capitoline and Palatine) in one City, and therefore must
have passed under the south end of the Palatine, close to this great
amphitheatre. Immediately in front of it, and separated from it only
by a paved street, the south end of the Summa Sacra Via is supported
by a rough concrete wall of the time of Sylla, and on the surface of
this concrete wall there are impressions of large blocks of tufa in the
plaster with which the concrete is covered. It is well known that Roman
mortar is often harder and more durable than stone. A few of the large
blocks of tufa also remain in their places, where they were necessary to
carry the vault of the platform above. These tufa blocks were used under
the _podium_ at the bottom, to the height of twenty feet, and parallel to
them is another wall of the same kind, with just room enough for a narrow
passage between them[3]. In these walls, on both sides, are vertical
grooves, evidently for lifts to be pulled up and let down, and larger
apertures at intervals for the counter-weights.

Behind this wall, under the path in front of the _podium_, are the
dens for the wild beasts. At the back of each den, in the corner, is a
vertical aperture about four feet square, descending from the passage
in front of the _podium_; this descends to ten feet from the ground
only, and was for the men to go down and feed the animals below without
being exposed to danger. In front of each den is a hole in the original
brick pavement, sometimes with a bronze socket remaining in its place.
These sockets (of which there are a great number in the pavement) are
evidently made for a pivot to work in each, and these pivots must have
been the lower end of a post for a capstan to wind the twenty-one feet
of cord upon, when the animal in his cage was pulled up to the top, and
the trap-door opened by the same cord from below, to let him jump out
when required for effect on the stage[4]. It is recorded by contemporary
authors that on several occasions a hundred lions leapt on to the stage
or arena at once. Some very curious _graffiti_, or scratchings on marble,
by the workmen of the third century, have been found, one of which
represents a hunt of wild beasts on the arena, in which apparently the
dogs have broken loose[5]. Another shews the framework of the netting of
gilt wire in front of the lower gallery[6].

There are five different representations of the Colosseum on the coins or
medals of the Emperors, one of Vespasian, two of Alexander Severus, and
one of Gordianus. These all appear to have been made from the architect’s
designs before the work was completed; there are slight variations in the
accessories, and the upper storey varies considerably. That of Gordianus
has for the legend or inscription—

                      MVNIFICENTIA GORDIANI AVG.[7]

This great tufa wall, on the inner line, has evidently been much shaken
by earthquakes in different parts, and the heads of the apertures (which
are square-headed when original) have frequently had arches introduced,
and are supported by brick walls of different periods[8]. In one instance
an arch of tufa had been much shaken, and this is supported by a brick
arch of the time of Nero[9]; there are also many other walls and arches
of his time in different parts of the building, which make it clear
that this building was the amphitheatre for the _gymnasium_ and the
_naumachia_ of Nero. It is the natural site for it, close to his great
palace, and the remains of that of Scaurus made him excellent foundations
to build upon, according to the fashion of his own time, which was
of brick, of the finest brickwork in the world. Those whose eyes are
accustomed to it can never mistake the brickwork of the time of Nero; his
awning is also mentioned; and the first book of the Epigrams of Martial
is full of incidents and spectacles in this amphitheatre.

Down the centre of the building, for the whole length, is a wide passage,
which was called _the gulf_[10], and which was necessary for sending
up the scenery, of which we read frequently, and which must have been
put together below, and then sent up to the stage, as wanted, by means
of this passage; there is no room for it anywhere else, and there was
no place behind the scenes for the actors and workmen, as in a modern
theatre. On each side of this great central passage are remains of two
canals for water, each about ten feet square, and about the same height
from the ground[11]; these were evidently filled with water supplied from
the aqueducts, and unmistakable traces of three reservoirs for water from
the aqueducts have been found in the first gallery. The four canals are
not all quite of the same period, nor on the same plan; one on each side
was supported on flat arches of brick of the third century, the other
on large beams of wood; the places to receive the ends of the beams are
left in the walls on each side of the passage for the workmen under it.
These walls are of such a thickness in proportion to their height, that
they were evidently made to support the great weight of water; these very
thick walls served instead of the great projection of the buttresses of
the usual reservoirs of the aqueducts.

There is no bond or junction of any kind between this _brick_ theatre,
or amphitheatre, and the magnificent _stone_ corridors and grand front
of the Flavian Emperors; these have evidently been added to a brick
building previously existing in the centre[12]. It had long been a matter
of wonder to all the great architects of Europe how it could be possible
to collect such an enormous mass of material of all kinds, and put them
together in ten years; to bring that quantity of travertine stone from
the quarries at Tivoli, twenty miles off, cut it, and erect it, was in
itself an enormous work. This gigantic building is in round numbers 500
ft. long, 300 ft. wide, and 120 ft. high above the foundations, and the
grand corridors are double all round, with the _vomitoria_, or stairs
from the seats at short intervals, and there are altogether six storeys,
including the _entresols_.

The upper storey was originally of wood, and was destroyed by a great
fire caused by lightning, in the time of the Emperor Macrinus; it was
rebuilding of stone during the whole reign of Alexander Severus, and
was completed by Gordianus III., who commemorated it by a medal, taking
the credit of the rebuilding to himself. There was a row of columns in
front of the upper gallery; two of the bases remain there, and a number
of capitals that belonged to that colonnade[13] have fallen down in
an earthquake, and are now lying about on the ground on the level of
the arena, but were found in the substructures. These are very rude
workmanship[14], perhaps only because they were to be seen from a great
distance, but they may possibly have been preserved from the works of
Scaurus; they are very different from the finished capitals used in
the lower gallery. This rebuilding and addition of the upper storey
alone took twenty years in a great building era. Great changes were
made at that time to raise the upper storey securely, and this we have
pointed out. It is seen that the builders had no faith in the soft tufa
for carrying any considerable weight, and provided piers of the hard
travertine at short intervals for that purpose[15]. There are altogether
six storeys in the present building, but three of them may be considered
as _entresols_ for passages to and from the _vomitoria_[16]. Gordianus
also rebuilt the front of one bay of the lower storey, which had probably
been damaged by some of the burning timber falling in front of it. At the
bottom of the great central passage was found a very remarkable wooden
framework, resembling what is usually called a cradle in a dockyard, and
used for a vessel to stand upon[17]. This cradle had the appearance of
having been burnt, but it is known that long exposure to extreme moisture
will give the same appearance to wood that burning it does. At the east
end of the passage, at the lowest level, is the great drain, half above
and half below the level of the old pavement[18]. At the entrance to
this are the grooves of a sluice-gate in the walls on each side, and
an original iron grating to prevent anything being carried through by
the rush of water; by this it is evident the water was let off from
the canals from time to time through this drain. Unfortunately the old
drain, which was at a great depth, was so much damaged that it was found
impracticable to repair it, though it was traced the whole length of the
building, as far as the Arch of Constantine at the opposite end[19].

These interesting discoveries made me think it expedient to pay fresh
visits to other amphitheatres, to examine them again more carefully
for the purpose of comparison; accordingly, I have been to those of
Capua[20], Pozzuoli, Pompeii, and Verona, and found, as I expected, many
confirmations of what had been stated in Rome. I took with me Professor
Cicconetti, one of the best architectural artists in Rome, to Capua and
Pozzuoli[21], and have added some photo-engravings from his drawings. I
have also been to Pompeii, and to Sicily, to see Syracuse and Taormina,
but did not think it necessary to take him there, or add more plates
from them. A great work on the Roman amphitheatres in general would be
very interesting, but it would be adding too much to the bulk and to
the cost of the present work. I believe that enough has been done to
illustrate and explain the Colosseum. I should add, that the common idea
that this colossal building is named from the Colossal Statue of Nero,
is a mistake. That statue, of 120 ft. high, could not have stood on the
basement or _podium_ on which the Roman antiquaries would place it, and
there is good evidence that a Colossal Statue of Gordianus, about half
the size, stood there. The great Colossus was moved by Hadrian from the
place on which the Temple of Rome was then built, on the east wall of
which the Marble Plan of Rome was fixed (now the church of SS. Cosmas
and Damian), to the SUMMA SACRA VIA, where it was used as the statue of
Apollo or the Sun, to which Hadrian added one of the Moon. Heliogabalus
rebuilt this temple of Egyptian granite, of which the columns are still
lying about[22] on the edges of the great platform, in the centre of
which now stands the church and monastery of S. Francesca Romana, the
campanile of which is of about the same height as the Colossus of Nero,
and stands near the same place.

  The old substructures were evidently retained and
    used when the upper part was built                       39

  Piers of travertine run from top to bottom of the
    building to carry the upper gallery, and the old
    tufa walls were cut through                             _ib._

  Substructures compared                                  47-52

  Space required for the actors is usually given behind
    the scenes in theatres, in an amphitheatre under
    the stage                                                47

  Vessels employed in the _Naumachia_ were usually
    _rates_, or rowing-boats                                _ib._

THE FLAVIAN AMPHITHEATRE, COMMONLY CALLED THE COLOSSEUM.


The importance of the great excavations made in 1874 and 1875 in this
colossal building, and the evidence obtained by them for the history
of the fabric, can hardly be overrated. It is now evident that the
substructures under the level of the base of the _podium_ are (when not
rebuilt) the earliest part of it, and considerably earlier than the time
of the Flavian Emperors, who built the magnificent front and corridors
around a theatre previously existing on that site.

This great amphitheatre is indeed enumerated by Suetonius[23] among the
works of Vespasian, and he adds that an amphitheatre in the centre of
Rome had been projected by Augustus. But he does not say that it was
then begun, and it seems evident that it was in use in the time of Nero
in connection with his great golden house, and was partly built by him,
but the exterior left unfinished. It contained the _stagna_, or _stagnum
navale_, called also _Vetus Naumachia_, made at a still earlier period on
the same site, which was called the old _naumachia_, when Augustus made
new and larger ones in the Trastevere. It also contained his gymnasium
on the boarded floor, or _arena_, of the theatre, over the _stagna
maritima_, or canals for the sham naval fights. We know nothing certain
as to the exact date of the commencement, but the building was continued
during the reign of Vespasian and till the second year of Titus, namely
A.D. 80, when it was dedicated. There is no evidence to prove that it was
_commenced_ even under Nero.

Pliny gives an account of a wooden amphitheatre built by Statilius
Taurus, which was in the Campus Martius; he says[24] that

    “he made two large theatres of wood, morticed together in a
    singular manner, and suspended so as to turn freely, in which
    on both sides were exhibited the afternoon shows of plays,
    then turning them round—nor were the scenes interrupted by the
    turning—quickly turning to face each other, and (intermediate)
    boards falling down; and the two parts held together by horns.
    He made an amphitheatre and exhibited the gladiatorial shows,
    carrying with him the consent of the greater part of the Roman
    people. For which was most to be admired, the inventor or the
    thing invented? The work or its author? To have thought of such
    a thing, or to have carried it out? To exhibit it, or permit
    it? Upon all these points there was a _furor_ of the people, to
    dare to sit on such an unsafe and unstable seat.”

This gave the form of an amphitheatre, or a theatre round at both ends,
and not with one side flat, as in the other theatres, but the two names
are often used indifferently; this set the fashion, and Julius Cæsar
followed it a few years afterwards in his great wooden amphitheatre; but
the turning round had been abandoned, and the advantage of substructures
under the stage would become apparent for making the shows still more
popular. It is mentioned as being very large, to admit of naval fights
with large vessels, but this was in the Campus Martius, and was a
temporary structure only, as stated by Dio Cassius[25].

The Theatre of M. Scaurus, the ædilis, is mentioned by Pliny[26] as being
on an enormous scale,—the _scena_ of triple height, with 360 columns, and
he enumerates it among the _insane_ works that were made at his private
cost. The upper part was of wood.

    “He made, during the time that he was _edile_, the greatest
    work that ever was made by human hands, not for temporary
    use only, but destined for eternity also[27]. This was _a
    theatre_; the _scena_ of it was _triple_ in height. There were
    three hundred and sixty columns in that building, of which
    six were brought from Hymettus, not without reproach at the
    sumptuousness of a citizen. The lowest part of the _scena_ was
    of marble, the middle part of glass, an unheard-of luxury in
    that kind of work; the highest part of gilt wood. The columns
    were at least thirty-eight feet high; the images between the
    columns were three thousand in number; the _cavea_ itself held
    eighty thousand people.”

_Scena_ usually means the stage for the actors to perform upon, but how
could this be triple, and three storeys high? To what other site in Rome,
excepting this great amphitheatre, which held 80,000 people, could all
this possibly apply?

This was in the time of Sylla; the site is not mentioned. Dio
mentions[28] a great flood in the time of Julius Cæsar, A.U.C. 694 (B.C.
59), extending as far as the great wooden theatre. The _clivus Scauri_
descends from that part of the Cœlian Hill on which the Claudium was
afterwards built, to the level of the road or street that leads from the
Circus Maximus to the Colosseum. All this was under water at the time of
the great flood in 1871.

The name of _cavea_ is said by Lipsius[29] to be applied to the
amphitheatre by several classical authors. He cites Ammianus
Marcellinus[30], Prudentius[31], and others, as using that name for it;
but they probably meant not only the hollow where the seats were placed,
but also the hollow space under the arena, with the dens for the wild
beasts, to which that name was also applied. Statius[32] uses the word
_cavea_ for the cages for lions, with doors round them, the closing of
which frightened the lions. Livy mentions iron cages (_caveas_), but
Claudian says that the animals were shut into wooden houses[33]; probably
the cages in which they were brought from the _vivaria_ were of iron, but
wooden cages (_pegmata_) were sufficient to place upon the lifts, and
send the animals up to the trap-doors[34].

Long before this time wild beasts had been brought into Rome for
exhibition, in the year 502 of Rome[35] (B.C. 251). Lucius Cæcilius
Metellus, the pro-consul, when he had conquered Sicily from the
Carthaginians, brought into Rome 142 elephants taken from them, which
he exhibited in the Circus Maximus. The custom of sending culprits to
execution by being torn to pieces by wild beasts is very ancient in
the East, as the well-known history of Daniel and the lions clearly
shews. The invention of circuses and amphitheatres for the exhibition
of hunts is attributed to the Athenians by Cassiodorus[36]; but it is
generally thought to be a Roman invention, although the name is Greek.
Livy[37] records that in the year 568 of Rome (B.C. 217), Marcus Fulvius
Nobilior, after the war with the Ætolians, exhibited for the first time
“the athletes, and the hunting of lions and panthers.”

In the year 586 of Rome (B.C. 227), Livy[38] also relates that “P.
Cornelius Scipio Nasica and P. Lentulus, the _Ædiles Curules_, exhibited
63 African wild beasts, 40 bears and elephants.” Martial, who was a
contemporary of Vespasian and Titus, Domitian and Trajan, has numerous
epigrams on the subject of scenes that took place in the Amphitheatre
of the Cæsars, by which he obviously means the Colosseum; a large part
of his first book, _de Spectaculis_, relates to such scenes on this
spot[39]. On one occasion, he mentions that a representation of Rhodope
(a mountain in Thrace), where Orpheus sang, with the rocks and woods,
was given upon the stage. It is evident from this, and from many other
passages in the classical authors, that the stage, called the ARENA, was
on the level of the _podium_, and visible to the people in every part of
the great theatre; and not at the bottom of a pit twenty feet deep, where
only a small number could have seen it, although some persons maintain
this opinion.

We are told by Suetonius again[40] in the life of Julius Cæsar, that—

    “these spectacles were exhibited in the Circus Maximus,
    in the circuit of the Euripus, with races of _bigæ_, and
    _quadrigæ_[41], and horses, with the young nobles for riders or
    drivers. Hunting of wild beasts for five days, and sham fights,
    castles being made over the _metæ_; a _stadium_ or stage was
    made in the Campus Martius for the athletes, and naval fights
    in the smaller _codeta_[42],” (which was in the Trastevere,
    and probably on the site on which Augustus afterwards made his
    great Naumachia,) “and in the lake then dug out, _biremes_, and
    _triremes_, and _quadriremes_[43] of the Tyrian and Ægyptian
    fleets, in great number, fought together. The whole population
    of Rome was attracted by those exhibitions, so that the streets
    and houses were quite empty; and from the pressure of the crowd
    several persons were crushed to death, including two senators.”

These attractive exhibitions obviously required a building especially
prepared and calculated for them, which Augustus proposed to provide,
but left for his successors to carry out the plan. It is probable that
in the time of Nero the great work was commenced on the site of that
of Scaurus[44], and making use of his substructures, was carried on
gradually, and eventually completed in this colossal building.

We are told that Nero made a Gymnasium and Naumachia in connection with
his great palace, or golden house, and no vestiges of any such buildings
have been found[45], unless both were combined in the great building
called the Colosseum from its colossal size. The amphitheatre at Capua,
being also a very large one, is said to have been called a Colosseum,
but on rather doubtful authority. It is, however, certain that the name
had nothing to do with the Colossus of Nero. It is evident that Nero
made a great reservoir of water on this spot, which was supplied from
his aqueduct on the Cœlian[46]. The _specus_, or channel for this water,
remains in the wall of the Claudium, on the northern side, opposite the
Palatine; and at the north-east corner of that part of the Cœlian Hill
on which the Claudium stood, are remains of a _piscina_ of the time of
Nero, obviously intended for the filtering-place before the water went
across into the Colosseum. At a short interval only, about a hundred
yards to the south of this, is another _piscina_ of the time of Alexander
Severus, when the upper storey was added, and the whole building repaired
after the great fire. It is quite possible that Nero made a large oval
reservoir on this spot, adjoining to his palace, supplied by an aqueduct,
similar to the great oval reservoir on the Palatine, near the house of
Augustus, excavated in 1872. The Romans were fond of the oval form for
a sheet of water; the basin of the fountain of Domitian, also on the
Palatine, is oval; and the remains of the fountain of Juturna in the
Forum Romanum shew the same form[47]. The long canals for the vessels to
float in, which are ten feet deep, about the same width, and the same
height above the original pavements, are not so early as the time of
Nero; they are of the third century, with many later repairs.

To include the Gymnasium in the same building, Nero made a wooden floor
over the reservoir, which he could remove and replace at pleasure; this
was covered with sand for the athletes to wrestle upon, and became THE
ARENA. Around this great oval basin galleries were erected for the
spectators, which were gradually enlarged and raised higher as the seats
were further off; and the great stone arcades of the Flavian Emperors,
with the corridors in them, are built round those older galleries, which
were chiefly faced with brick. Several of the arches of the galleries, in
the fine brickwork of Nero, remain in the Colosseum[48]; and the stone
arcades were evidently built up against them without any junction between
the two in any part. The bricks on the side of the arch next the stone
piers of the corridors, are in many places cut in half, to make way for
the stone piers. The straight vertical joints between the brick galleries
and the stone arcades are often two or three inches wide; this may be
the effect of an earthquake, but there is no bonding between one and the
other. The enormous arcades and corridors are in themselves a gigantic
work, and it was evidently difficult to obtain so great a supply of
materials.

The external wall and corridor are of three periods. The first is the
ground floor only, with the Doric order of columns; the first and second
floor, with the Corinthian columns, belong to the second period, and it
is a little later than the lowest part, but not with any long interval;
the upper floor is an addition of the third century, and replaces a
wooden storey.

In the interior of the building, as we are told in the anonymous
chronicle published by Eccard, which is good authority[49], Vespasian
dedicated the three lower steps, and Titus added two others to the
three placed by his father. The wooden gallery, built upon the top of
the great corridors or arcades (for the plebs), appears to have been an
afterthought, not part of the original design, but an addition obviously
called for. The large space at that height gave accommodation for an
enormous number of people, which could not have been given before, to
see what was going on upon the ARENA or STAGE during the performance.
This had numerous trap-doors in it, under which were lifts for the wild
beasts in their cages to be sent up on to the stage when wanted. The
performance was in many respects like our pantomimes. There are evident
traces of the lifts below, by the vertical grooves in the tufa walls for
them to slide up and down[50]; and recesses remain in these walls for
the counter-weights also to work in, with holes in the pavement for the
sockets of pivots for the capstans necessary to wind up the cords, and
loose them as required. These original walls, with the grooves for the
old machines, are in many parts interfered with by more modern walls
built up between them, probably in the fifth and sixth centuries, when
great repairs were made after earthquakes, or perhaps rendered necessary
by the weight of the water under the wooden floor in the central part.

Two important inscriptions relating to the history of the building have
been preserved[51]: one found in 1810 on the western side, recording
the repairs after an earthquake by the præfect Basilius, A.D. 445; the
other in 1813, recording similar repairs by Lampadius, A.D. 508. Three
of the marble seats were also brought to light, one with the number
XVIII., another with the word EQUITI, the third, with an inscription, the
beginning of which is broken off:—

                    tr IB IN . THEATR . LEGE . PL . VI
                         vind ICET . P . X . II.

This is important, because it shews the use of the word THEATRUM[52],
and not AMPHITHEATRUM, for the colossal building; which agrees with the
usage of Dio and other contemporary authors, who always call it THEATRUM
_par eminence_, or the great theatre of Rome, there being no need to
distinguish it further.

The following extracts from Dio Cassius can only apply to the great
amphitheatre:—

    “Such was the shamelessness of Nero, that he himself drove
    chariots in public; and, sometimes, having slain wild beasts,
    and having suddenly introduced water into the area, he made a
    naval battle; and then withdrawing the water, he introduced
    the gladiatorial strife. Then again introducing it, he gave
    in public a sumptuous supper. Tigellinus was the prefect (or
    overseer) of the supper, and it was a supper of the grandest
    magnificence, arranged in this manner. In the middle of the
    amphitheatre and in the water great wooden wine-casks were
    placed, and upon them a floor of planks[53] was laid, and
    around this, booths and small chambers were erected[54].”

    “Nero had various kinds of shows in the amphitheatre, sometimes
    filling it with sea-water, in which fishes and sea monsters
    swam, and made a naval fight between the Persians and the
    Athenians; then suddenly withdrawing the water, and drying the
    ground, he ordered a number of men on foot to rush in, not
    singly, but in numbers and close together[55].”

    “When he (Titus) dedicated the theatre for hunting, and the
    thermæ called after him, he exhibited many wonderful things.
    Cranes fought and four elephants, nine thousand wild boars and
    other beasts were killed, which women, even some of noble rank,
    had brought together. Many contests, also, on foot, and naval
    fights took place, for suddenly filling the amphitheatre with
    water, he introduced horses and bulls, and other tame animals,
    who had been taught to act in the water as on land. He also
    introduced men in ships, who, in the guise of Corcyrians and
    Corinthians, imitated a naval battle[56].”

In another chapter Dio repeats the same account, with the addition of “a
public supper[57].” This shews that the arrangements in the amphitheatre
were the same in the time of Nero as in the time of Commodus, when
Dio was himself present, and describes what he saw. If the water was
really _sea_-water, it could only have been in the canals. The fact of
three aqueducts having converged to this point to bring water to the
great building, makes it most probable that the water was not _really
sea-water_, but perhaps had _sea-weed_ inserted in it to suit the fishes
and the sea monsters. Suetonius also mentions the _naumachia_ in the
amphitheatre[58] in the time of Domitian, among the magnificent shows
that he provided for the people. Dio clearly distinguishes between the
Amphitheatre of Nero and that of Statilius Taurus in the Campus Martius,
which he also calls _Theatrum Tauri_[59].

The word _stagnum_ is commonly translated _pond_, but it does not
necessarily mean _only_ a pond; any reservoir of water might be so
called; the _castellum aquæ_, or large cistern for the water supplied
by the aqueducts, was also a _stagnum_. The “Stagna Neronis[60]” are
mentioned by Martial, as well as by Tacitus[61], who also mentions a
_stagnum navale_ among the games in the public theatre of Augustus[62].

Suetonius[63] compares the Stagnum of Nero to a “sea” surrounded by the
buildings of a city: a strong expression, which shews that there were
some buildings immediately round it. The Claudium on the Cœlian, the
Porticus Liviæ on the Summa Sacra Via, and Porticus of Nero himself on
the Esquiline, would be visible on three sides of it. The representation
of this great building on the coin of Titus was evidently taken from the
design of the architect. It represents a building of two storeys only,
with gigantic statues under each of the arches of the corridors.

The _new naumachia_ made by Augustus in the Trastevere were larger
reservoirs for the same purpose; this _naumachia_ is also called a
_stagnum_ by Tacitus[64], who describes a similar scene in the _stagnum_
of Agrippa[65] (which was in his _thermæ_, near the Pantheon), with
the letting in the water suddenly for a naval battle; and then letting
it off again as suddenly, and having a supper in the same place; he
also mentions the _stagna_ of Nero[66], and the _stagnum navale_ of
Augustus[67]. The _stagnum_ of Agrippa was supplied with water by his
aqueduct (the Virgo), and it has been mentioned that those of Nero
were supplied by three aqueducts, two from the Cœlian and one from the
Esquiline. The remains of the _specus_ and of the _piscinæ_ have been
already mentioned[68]. There are slight remains of three reservoirs in
the gallery, lined with the peculiar cement used only for the aqueducts,
called _opus signinum_. From the Esquiline the water was brought to
the Amphitheatre in leaden pipes, after serving the Thermæ of Titus;
a quantity of these leaden pipes have been found in excavations at
different periods[69], as recorded at the time by eye-witnesses, and
some of them are still preserved as mementoes in the office of the
Municipality.

Suetonius[70] mentions that some of the amusements for the people
provided by Nero were held in the wooden amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus
in the Campus Martius, but he mentions the _naumachia_ separately,
and we have no account of any _stagnum_ having been there, nor is it
probable, as it could only have been supplied with water by the aqueduct
of Agrippa, and it was originally built before that aqueduct was made.
The _naumachia_ were an essential part of the amusements of many Roman
amphitheatres, and there are considerable remains of the canals for them
at Capua and at Tusculum.

Suetonius, in his life of Titus, thus writes:—

    “Having dedicated the _Amphitheatre_, and having quickly
    completed the Thermæ hard by, he provided the most magnificent
    and expensive entertainment [for the people]. He exhibited
    a naval fight _in the old Naumachia_, and also a combat of
    gladiators; and, in one day also, five thousand wild beasts of
    all sorts[71].”

Those _stagna_ were boarded over for the gladiators and for the wild
beasts, but the boards could be moved and naval fights exhibited at
other times, as had previously been done on the same spot in “the
old Naumachia[72].” The account of the scenes that took place here,
described by Dio Cassius, agrees with this. The excavations made in 1814
shewed that there were canals built of brick running parallel to each
other the whole length of the area, as at Capua, and in several other
amphitheatres; these were, no doubt, for the naval fights. The vessels
were probably towed along from the opposite ends, and where they met were
lashed together, and the sailors of one of them tried to board the other:
to prevent this was the naval fight. Probably the space between these two
canals was flooded when the water was let in. These canals, reservoirs,
or _stagna_, were brought out more clearly in 1875, and the substructures
which supported them were then made visible[73].

In the corridors are many remains of the open channels for the water
brought from the aqueducts. They are not more than a foot deep, often
not so much, being frequently much worn: when perfect they are nearly
of that depth, and are lined with the peculiar cement used only for the
aqueducts, called _Opus signinum_, and in Italian, _Coccio-pesto_. This
is an invariable mark of an aqueduct; this open channel must have been
brought across from the Cœlian reservoir on the colonnade, shewn upon
the coin of Titus. The system of drainage for the rain-water is quite
distinct from the channels for the aqueducts.

The floor of the ARENA for the gymnastics and the slaughter of wild
beasts was of wood covered with sand; on one occasion (as we have shewn)
placed upon wine-barrels in the parts that had been flooded; the boards
could be removed or replaced with facility. It was full of trap-doors
with lifts under them, some large for the animals to jump through, these
are over the passage round the outer line, in front of the dens under
the _podium_; others smaller for men and dogs for the hunt; these are on
each side of the central passage. Large corbels, with bold projections
for placing the boards upon when removed from the floor of the stage,
are provided over the stream of water, in front of the _podium_, but
at a lower level; they are in pairs six feet apart, and also served
to stiffen the lower end of the masts or poles for the awning; on the
surface of them a notch is cut to place the boards upon, and ready access
was given by the passage in front of the _podium_. The gymnasium and the
_stagna_ were in one and the same building used for both purposes, and
Nero probably built galleries of brick round it for the accommodation
of the people, according to the fashion of his time. The exterior was
left unfinished for some years, and completed of stone by Titus and the
Flavian emperors on a more magnificent scale. The space for the upper
galleries was afterwards very much enlarged by building them upon the
magnificent double arcades of stone round it, and so completing the great
building known as the Colosseum. The straight vertical joint, which is
plainly seen between the old brickwork within and these stone galleries
and corridors, and the want of any bond between them, is thus accounted
for[74]. The upper gallery for the common people was an addition to the
original design over these arcades and corridors, and was originally of
wood; it was destroyed by fire caused by lightning in the time of the
Emperor Macrinus, A.D. 217, and restored in stone in about twenty-three
years, having been completed by Gordianus III., A.D. 240. To support
this upper gallery of stone at that enormous height vertical piers
of travertine are introduced, cutting through the walls of the lower
galleries from top to bottom[75]; these walls are of tufa, faced with
brick. In several instances portions of these piers of travertine have
been removed for building purposes in the Middle Ages, and the space that
had been occupied by the piers is left empty. The brick facing of the
walls on either side stands just as firm without these travertine piers
as with them, a clear proof that their object was to support the upper
gallery when it was rebuilt in stone, and not to support the brick walls
of the lower one through which they were cut, although they appear to do
so. This accounts for the fact that in the brick arches of construction
(as they are called), the bricks, originally two feet square, are cut
down to a few inches[76].

The names of _stagnum_ or _stagna_, and _naumachia_, are evidently used
indifferently by the classical authors. It has been already mentioned
that in the description of the far-famed palace of Nero, reaching from
the Esquiline to the Palatine Hill, Suetonius also speaks of it having “a
lake (_stagnum_) like a sea surrounded by buildings, after the fashion
of cities[77].” This could only apply to the Colosseum, and from this it
would appear that in the time of Nero the surface could be flooded when
required for theatrical display. Probably in two parts, divided by the
great central passage or the gulf, and these two parts were called the
_stagna_. It must always be remembered that the one object of the whole
building was a theatre for the amusement of the people, very much like
the Crystal Palace for London.

The probability is that some of the walls of the buildings of Nero round
his _stagna_ were used as part of the lower galleries of the Colosseum;
these walls and arches are a mixture of stone and brick, and some of
the brickwork has quite the character of the time of Nero, so well
known to Roman antiquaries as the finest brickwork in the world[78].
The excavations of 1874 and 1875 have confirmed this opinion; there
is a series of arches over the entrance to the dens for wild beasts,
under the _podium_, which are distinctly of the well-known brickwork of
Nero. Some of these walls of the substructure are earlier than the time
of Nero, others are later, with large repairs of the fifth and sixth
centuries. The great external corridors are entirely built of stone, and
are evidently added on to the galleries; there is a straight joint from
top to bottom in all parts, and no junction with ties anywhere in the
original construction. The construction of the walls of the Colosseum
in the interior shews such evident patchwork of different periods, that
it is impossible to believe they were all built within ten years, as is
commonly said.

In many other places besides Rome, part of the amphitheatre was at times
filled with water for the exhibition of naval fights, indeed the actual
remains of the conduit for the water are shewn in more than one place.
At Verona, where the area of the amphitheatre is considerably below the
level of the adjacent ground, the conduit or _specus_ is shewn at the
level of the second gallery, and below that of the upper one, and the
water seems to have gone down a cascade into the end of a corridor or
passage at the lowest level. At Capua the aqueduct for bringing in the
water and a large drain for carrying it off rapidly, are shewn, both at a
low level[79]. In either of these cases, the substructure is to a great
extent filled up with vaulted brick chambers separated by passages, but
the walls and vaults are lined with that peculiar cement that resists
water, and thus a great part of the surface may have been covered with
water to a sufficient depth for the purpose. At Puteoli or Pozzuoli,
near Naples, the underground chambers of the amphitheatre are unusually
perfect, and the brick floor over them, with numerous trap-doors, with
deep grooves round the edge for a cover to fit tight over them when
the surface was flooded[80]; at Tusculum one of the canals has been
excavated, the other is still buried. From these it appears that the
naval fights were represented as in a river, rather than in the sea.
There are two long straight passages, the whole length of the central
space, with no doors in them; and the walls are faced with the peculiar
water-cement. These passages are wide enough for a trireme to pass along,
and it seems more probable that the naval fight took place on this sort
of river than on the whole surface, which would have been necessary for a
sea-fight.

This obviously applies equally to the Colosseum, where the great
excavations in 1875 shewed that there were _two_ canals on each side of a
great central passage, parallel to it and to each other, with an interval
of about six feet between them, which was flooded when the water was
let in to make two fine sheets of water the whole length of the arena,
each about three hundred feet long and fifty feet wide[81]. These were
just under the boards, which were carried away and placed on the corbels
provided for them in front of the _podium_, but below the level of the
base of it. The walls to support this body of water are unusually thick,
and have buttresses on both sides for greater strength[82]. The two
canals were not of the same width, but of the same depth, ten feet, with
passages, ten feet high, under them. The most narrow canal is nearest to
the centre, and has been supported on great beams of wood resting upon
the massive walls; the places for the ends of the beams are left at short
intervals in the walls. The other and wider canal had brick arches to
support it, which remain, though the great leaden cistern in the form of
a canal has been destroyed.

The two great lofty walls of tufa are independent of the brick walls
supporting the canals. The lifts, or _pegmata_ for the wild beasts,
were placed in the outer passage between the two tufa walls, just under
the edge of the _podium_[83]. On each side of the central passage are
a series of small square closets for lifts, for men and dogs to ascend
from the passages at the lowest level to the floor above, through the
trap-doors. These continue visible for the whole length of the surface
and central passage. The pavement of these passages is of brick in
herring-bone fashion, such as was common in Rome during the first three
centuries. Some persons have imagined that the walls are built upon
this pavement, but if this is the case anywhere, of which there is no
evidence, it would only be a part of the later repairs of the fifth or
sixth century.

There are some portions of a third wall of tufa parallel to the other
two, and within them; this has been much damaged, and very little of
it remains. In one place, near the south-west end, there is an arch in
this tufa wall apparently much shaken by an earthquake, and consequently
supported by two brick arches of Nero, one under it, the other abutting
against it, like a flying buttress in a medieval church[84]. The long,
thin bricks of the time of Nero are perfectly well known to all Roman
archæologists, and are only met with in buildings of his time. Two other
small square chambers, one on either side of the great central passage,
also remain at the south end, with an arch of the brickwork of Nero on
each side[85]. These chambers are enclosed in stone, so that half the
thickness of the wall is of brick, the other half of travertine. This
wall, therefore, affords conclusive evidence that there was a great
theatre on this spot before the time of Vespasian, and that the tufa
walls are _earlier_ than the time of Nero.

We are expressly told that Augustus had intended to build an amphitheatre
here, but had not done so. We have no mention of Claudius having built
one, we are therefore driven back to an earlier period (probably to
the amphitheatre of Scaurus, in the time of Sylla) for the date of the
tufa walls, with the grooves for lifts, or _pegmata_, in them, as has
been mentioned. Outside of these great walls of tufa, and under the
path in front of the _podium_, are a number of dens for lions, or other
wild beasts of that size[86]. And in front of each is an opening large
enough for the animal to pass through into a cage placed on a lift in
the passage between the two tufa walls, and in each of these walls are
vertical grooves cut in them for the lifts to work up and down; also
deeper grooves, about a yard long, for the counter-weights[87]. Behind
the place for each cage, in the passage, is a socket let into the
pavement for a pivot to work in[88], apparently for a capstan or post to
wind the cord upon to pull up the lifts and cages. These cages were of
wood, and called _pegmata_. The word _pegma_ is used in different senses
by Pliny, Martial, and others for a wooden box, cage, or framework; and
the wild beasts were brought in such cages from the places where they
were kept outside the walls, called _vivaria_.

There were two _vivaria_, one on the southern side of the Prætorian Camp,
of which there are some remains. The evidence for this is an inscription
of the time of Gordianus III. (A.D. 241), which mentions a keeper of
the _vivarium_[89] belonging to the sixth Cohort of the Prætorian and
Urban[90] Guards. The other was on the southern side of the Sessorium,
which was both a palace and a Prætorian Camp.

The _podium_ was protected by nets[91]; and there were projecting
bars for rollers, which turned round when touched, so that the claws
of an animal could have no hold upon them: these are mentioned by
Calpurnius. Seneca, in his Epistle (88) uses the word _pegma_ for
“a wooden machine in the theatres,” which raised and lowered itself
_imperceptibly_—evidently what we now call a lift—the machinery of which
was not seen by the spectators. Wooden towers used on the stage in sham
fights were also called _pegmata_[92]. The following account given by
Seneca[93], who wrote about A.D. 20, of these machines, clearly applies
to the Colosseum and the substructures under it. As that was before the
time of the Flavian Emperors, it is probable that the wooden amphitheatre
on this spot was in existence in his time, and that the tufa walls for
the lifts now remaining were then standing and in use. He says—

    “There are games that give pleasure to the eyes and the ears.
    Among these we may enumerate the machines which cause the cages
    to raise themselves, and silently rise to the top of the wooden
    floor (or stage), and others in unexpected variety, either
    gaping open or coalescing again, others which were distant
    drawing together again spontaneously, or those which were near
    gradually retiring from each other. The eyes of the silly
    people are astonished at all these sudden movements, the causes
    of which they do not understand.”

Juvenal, writing about A.D. 100, also mentions the _pegmata_ in the
Colosseum[94], with the _velaria_.

There is a small stream of water in front of the dens, supplied by the
aqueducts, from which the animals could drink. Behind each den is a small
cell, four feet square, descending from above, called _catabolicus_[95],
but not lower than ten feet from the ground, apparently for a man to go
down and feed them safely.

In what seems the earliest part of the two tufa walls, near the
south-west end of the building, the apertures in the inner part are
square-headed doorways, and not arches[96]. These are filled up with
brick walls of the time of the Flavian emperors, or later[97]. In other
parts of these tufa walls there are arches in the inner wall, also
supported by brick arches of the time of the Flavian emperors, in which
the bricks are thicker, and there is more mortar between them than in
those of the time of Nero.

On the floor of the central passage is a remarkable piece of ancient
wooden framework lying on the ground[98], which has the appearance at
first sight of having been burnt, but long exposure to wet will have the
same effect on wood that fire has. (The Irish bog-oak often appears as
if it had been burnt, and wood has been dug from under the foundations
of an Irish round tower that had the same appearance.) This framework is
a good deal worn, as if it had been much used; it has all the appearance
of a dry dock, or a cradle for a vessel to stand upon. When the _stagnum
navale_ of Nero was in use, there must have been some machinery for
lifting up the vessels and placing them on the canals. They must also
have been removed out of the way when the water was let off, and the
boarded floor of the stage or arena replaced[99].

On each side of this wooden framework is a series of slabs of stone
about a yard square, placed upright, with a hole through each for a
water-course. These seem to have been for fixing the wooden frame of a
_cradle_ for the vessels to stand upon, and to keep them upright. This
plan is well shewn in a drawing of a trireme that was made for Napoleon
III., to shew the French people what a Roman trireme was like[100].

It is well known that the general form of the Colosseum is oval, and
that it had four principal entrances, one of which only remains; this
is said to have been the entrance for the emperor and his suite, it is
not numbered as the other entrances and seats were[101]. The theatre,
as we are told in the Regionary Catalogues, was calculated to hold
87,000 people, and was admirably adapted for its purpose. There were
four principal staircases, by which the spectators could ascend to the
highest tier of seats, and these were so arranged that the different
orders could disperse without meeting each other. The numerous places of
egress, called _vomitoria_, and the windows to light the staircases, were
contrived with great skill.

Vast as this amazing edifice still is, the whole of the outer wall
with the arcades and corridors, on the south and west sides, have been
destroyed, having been used as a stone quarry for building some of the
largest palaces in Rome, but on the north and east sides it is tolerably
perfect. A correct idea of the whole can only be formed by mounting to
the top, and surveying the whole extent from thence. The finest view of
the exterior is from the Thermæ of Titus, or the windows or the garden
of the monastery of S. Pietro in Vincoli, on the hill opposite the north
front.

The great mass of the building under the corridors is of tufa, and was
probably taken from that part of the second wall of Rome which passed
under the south end of the Palatine close at hand; each block of tufa,
being of large size and a ton in weight, was likely to be brought from
the nearest point. It has been mentioned that there are piers of
travertine at short intervals, as if the builders were afraid to trust
the soft tufa to carry so great a weight[102]. These piers go right
through the walls from top to bottom, to carry the weight of the upper
gallery when full of people; tufa is too soft a material to be trusted
for this purpose, and the brick facing did not add materially to the
strength. It is faced with cut stone (travertine) on the exterior, and
with brick on the interior. The work, as said before, was evidently
carried on for a long time. Three periods may be perceived[103] in the
stonework, with apparently an interval of some years between them. The
upper storey is of a later date, of the time of Alexander Severus and
Gordianus, and was evidently completed in great haste, of materials
previously prepared, (as may be distinctly seen in the interior); this
upper wall is built also in the most slovenly manner, with portions of
cornices and of columns, or fragments of old tombs, built into it as mere
pieces of stone[104]. On the interior of this wall large corbels remain
distinctly visible, which could only be for the floor of the wooden
gallery.

In the lower series of seats the vaults under them are not original,
except those on the ground-floor; and in the corridors the large corbels
for wooden floors and galleries still project from the face of the wall
very distinctly[105]. The mixture of stone and brick in the construction
is curious, and in several parts indicates the great repairs in the fifth
and sixth centuries recorded by inscriptions found during the excavations.

There is a series of arches on the first floor within, some of them
begun, and some completed, in stone, but the greater part have springing
stones only upon the stone jambs, the arches afterwards being completed
in brick, and brick vaults introduced in place of the original wooden
floors and galleries; above, nearly all is brick, except the corridors
and the outer facing. The construction of this part is very good
throughout; the stones are in large oblong blocks, closely fitted
together, originally held with iron clamps, fragments of which remain,
as may be seen or felt in the interior of the building in apertures of
the wall: the holes where other iron clamps have been, are left all over
the face of the building, and in the corridors, always at the edges of
the stones, where in rusting they have split the stone and fallen out.
They were of this form [symbol][106]. On the west side, where the outer
wall is gone, the inner wall (now external) shews distinctly the flat
pilasters of stone carried up nearly to the top, but left unfinished, and
continued with brick afterwards.

Nothing is known with certainty of the architect of the work; an
inscription found in the Catacomb of S. Agnes, in memory of Gaudentius,
has given rise to the legend that he was the architect[107], and that he
afterwards suffered as a martyr within its walls. Twelve thousand Jewish
slaves are said to have been employed upon it during five years, and ten
million Roman scudi expended upon it in the same time.

The fine tomb of one of the family of the Aterii found at Cento Celle,
and now preserved in the Lateran Museum, is covered with panels of
sculpture of numerous buildings packed closely together, of which there
is reason to believe some are only designs, and were never executed.
This makes it probable that it was the tomb of an architect, and one of
the sculptures represents the Summa Sacra Via as he thought it ought to
have been. One building is a triumphal arch, with a colossal figure under
it, and an inscription on the cornice—ARCVS IN SACRA VIA SVMMA; another
triumphal arch has the inscription ARCVS AD ISIS. Between these two is
seen the Colosseum looking down upon it, represented as of two storeys
only, and not quite the same as the existing building, but the figures
under the arches are shewn as on the coin. Another sculpture on the same
tomb represents the machine for raising large stones to the top of a high
wall or building, described in Part III. of this work (Construction,
p. 91). From the circumstance of this machine being represented upon
the tomb, it seems most probable that the person here interred was the
inventor, or had made some improvement in it, and that it was especially
intended for the Colosseum, for which it certainly would have been very
useful. The date of the tomb is of the first century[108]. Such a machine
is mentioned by Vitruvius, and similar machines are still in use in some
parts of Switzerland.

The numerous walls that intersect the space under the stage shew clearly
that there could be no area in this theatre, that there is no open space
excepting on the stage itself, and this was the boarded floor, called the
_arena_, from the sand with which it was covered. The latter is quite a
different thing from an _area_, and yet almost all the modern writers
on the antiquities of Rome fall into this mistake. The passage cited in
a previous page from Dio Cassius, who describes what he saw, is quite
decisive that the arena was a boarded floor covered with sand.

A great number of large marble columns and capitals of the Composite
order, rudely worked, as if on purpose to be seen from a great distance
only, have rolled down from the edge of the upper gallery to the arena
below, probably in an earthquake. They must have fallen before the
substructures were filled up with earth, as many of them were found at
the bottom on the old pavement, which they had damaged by falling upon
it, and some have made holes through great walls, and were found lying
with half the column on the inner side of the wall, and the other half
on the outer one. Probably the cords for the awning were caught on the
entablature of this colonnade as they passed, the length from top to
bottom being too great to keep them tight. There must have been at least
a hundred of these columns; possibly there were two colonnades, the
second on the edge of one of the lower galleries, but they are work of
the third century, not earlier, and as the upper gallery was added at
that time, they must have belonged to that period.

The Flavian Amphitheatre and Meta Sudans are represented on four coins
of the emperors, one of Vespasian[109], A.D. 80, with the head of Titus,
and inscription on the obverse. This is a bird’s-eye view, represented
with the walls of the two storeys, and with the Meta Sudans on one
side, and a double range of columns on the opposite side, one over the
other. This medal was used by Fontana in his plans and drawings of a
restoration[110], though he does not give an engraving of it. The upper
storey is very different from the existing building; in the interior the
upper gallery is evidently represented on this medal as of wood; the
colonnade or arcade, of two storeys, connecting the amphitheatre with the
Cœlian, seen on the coin, was most probably to carry the shallow open
channel of water from the Aqueduct[111]. The second of Domitian, nearly
the same as the last, but with a double arcade instead of colonnade; the
third of Alexander Severus, with the Meta Sudans[112] on the right, and
a group of figures on the left. There are two coins of this emperor with
the same subject on the reverse, not of the same size, and not quite
alike. The fourth of Gordianus III., with the legend on the obverse,
IMP . GORDIANUS . PIVS . FELIX . AVG.; on the reverse the view of the
Colosseum, as if looking down upon it, with the masts for the awning,
and a wild-beast hunt going on at a high level, certainly not at the
bottom (as has been said). On the left, standing behind the Meta Sudans,
is a colossal figure about fifty feet high[113]. On the right is a small
building which is just below, and a gable end to the roof, probably
the _piscina_ of Alexander Severus, of which we have remains. Over the
Colosseum is the legend MUNIFICENTIA GORDIANI AVG.[114] In this the upper
storey is represented as of stone.

A.D. 150. By the time of Antoninus Pius the amphitheatre needed repairs,
as we learn that it was restored by him[115].

In A.D. 191, Dio Cassius, who was a Roman senator in the time of
Commodus, was an eye-witness of the games, and gives an account of the
manner in which that emperor amused himself in this amphitheatre.

    “He used to put on, before he entered the amphitheatre, a tunic
    with sleeves made of white silk embroidered with gold, and
    thus habited we (the Senators) saluted him; but on entering it
    he put on his purple robe sprinkled with gold, like a Greek
    _chlamys_, and a gold crown with Indian jewels; he was also
    accustomed to carry a _caduceus_ like Mercury. In the street
    some one carried before him a lion’s skin and a club. But when
    he went into the theatre he sat on a gold seat. He also entered
    the theatre in the costume of Mercury, and threw aside the
    other things which he had carried except the tunic.

    “On the first day he alone killed a hundred bears with javelins
    thrown from the paths in the upper part. For the amphitheatre
    being everywhere divided by diametrical partitions, each
    division having a roof, round which he could go, he could the
    more readily strike down the wild beasts, who were themselves
    divided into four divisions....

    “These things being done on the first day, on other days
    he descended from the upper place into the area of the
    amphitheatre, and killed the fatted beasts when they came near
    to him, or were led to him, or brought in cages; he killed a
    tiger, and an hippopotamus, and an elephant: having done these
    things he went away. Then after dinner he went through the
    gladiatorial exercise armed as a gladiator, with the shield
    on his right arm, and holding the wooden sword in his left
    hand, of which he was very proud, as he was left-handed....
    For fourteen days exhibitions of this kind were continued, and
    I can certify that we senators always came with the knights,
    except Claudius Pompeianus, the senior, he never was there, but
    sent his sons to see the shows....

    “But of the rest of the people many did not go into the
    amphitheatre, and some after they had seen a little went away,
    some from being ashamed of what they saw done there, others
    from fear, because it was reported that the Emperor wished
    to kill some of them with arrows as Hercules formerly killed
    the Stymphalidæ.... This fear was common to all, belonging
    not more to others than to us; for even to us Senators he did
    things in such a manner, that for any cause we expected to be
    killed. He even killed an ostrich and cut off its head, when
    he came to the place where we were seated, holding in his left
    hand the head and in his right his bloody sword, and saying
    nothing, he moved it grinning, to shew he would serve us in the
    same manner; and which many people laughed at seeing our fear,
    &c.... These things being done he comforted us, and ordered
    us, when he was fighting in the manner of a gladiator, to go
    into the theatre in our habits and cloaks as knights: in which
    costume we were not accustomed to go into the theatre except
    on the death of the Emperor. It happened also to him that on
    the last day of the games his helmet was carried through the
    door by which the dead were usually carried, which things, in
    the opinion of many, were done to indicate to every body his
    approaching death. It is certain that soon after he died, or
    rather was killed[116].”

The spectators were protected from the heat of the sun by a great awning,
which was suspended from masts or poles at the top by cords. Pliny
mentions an awning painted in imitation of the sky, with stars in it, in
the amphitheatre of the Prince Nero[117]. There were similar poles at
the bottom also, to support the lower end of the cords over the heads of
the spectators in the galleries[118]. These are likely to have had the
great beams of the screen in the front of the _podium_ fixed to them. The
contrivances for supporting them at the top were very ingenious, and can
still be seen. On the exterior there is a row of corbels, ten feet below
the summit, for the ends of the poles to rest upon, and holes are left in
the cornice for them to pass through. These masts stood full twenty feet
above the walls; and on the inner side of the upper wall are also corbels
for the cords to be fastened to, to keep them upright. At the bottom of
the galleries, in front of the _podium_, there are similar contrivances
to support the poles for the awning, a recess in the wall of tufa, with
a piece of travertine let in for the lower ends to stand upon, and long
corbels on each side to support and stiffen the lower part[119]. The
central space was not covered over, and the athletes were exposed to
the weather. There is an excellent representation of an amphitheatre,
with the awning partly closed and partly open, in a fresco-painting of
the first century at Pompeii, which has been engraved in the valuable
Journal of Pompeii, edited by the learned Keeper of the Museum, Sig. Com.
Fiorelli[120]. The construction of the upper walls is quite different
from, and very inferior to that of the great arcades; this belonging
to the third century, not to the first; and part of it has all the
appearance of having been completed in a great hurry, as we see in the
interior many pieces of stone evidently prepared for other parts of the
building, and used as blocks of old material only, some with inscriptions
on them, apparently taken from tombs[121]. The tradition is that the
Emperor Gordianus insisted on the completion of the building-contract by
the time appointed, which was done with great difficulty.

A large number of sailors were kept continually employed in furling and
unfurling the great awning, and attending to the machinery. They had a
camp provided for them near at hand, called Castra Misenatium, because
the sailors came originally from the fleet at Misenum (in the bay of
Naples). The exact site of this camp has not been ascertained. Some
suppose it to have been on the Cœlian, near where the _navicella_, or
model of a galley in marble, now stands[122], but it was not in that
Regio; it must have been on the Esquiline, immediately to the north of
the great building, or on the Velia. The awning was called _vela_ or
_vehela_, an old Latin word, from which came also the name of _velabrum_,
meaning “sails.” The modern name “veil” is supposed to come from it.

Calpurnius[123] describes a visit to Rome by a country lad, and gives an
account of the amphitheatre:—

    “We saw the theatre (amphitheatre) with interwoven beams
    rising to heaven, so high as almost to overlook the Tarpeian
    rock, and the immense steps and the sloping passages gently
    descending.... What shall I describe further? I saw all kinds
    of wild beasts, ... not only those carniverous monsters of
    the forest, but sea-monsters together with fighting bears. I
    saw seals, and herds of shapeless animals bearing the name of
    horses (hippo-potami), but deformed, the offspring of the
    Nile. Oh how often have we trembling seen the arena sinking
    in parts, and a gulf burst open in the ground from which wild
    beasts have emerged[124].”

In A.D. 217, the amphitheatre was struck by lightning and burnt under
Macrinus, as we are told by Dio Cassius. This passage shews that the
upper storeys were of wood, and that there was much woodwork about the
galleries and corridors.

    “The amphitheatre also was struck by lightning on the very
    day of the Vulcanalia (23rd of August), all was consumed to
    such an extent that the upper precinct and whatever was on
    the area was burned, and all the remaining part shivered in
    pieces by the heat; nor could the fire have been extinguished
    by human means, although there was plenty of water, had there
    not also been copious and vehement rain from the heavens. All
    the gladiatorial games, consequently, for many years were
    transferred to the Stadium[125].”

The restoration was begun in the time of Heliogabalus[126], and continued
through the whole reign of Alexander Severus[127], A.D. 222-235; and
finished under Gordianus III., A.D. 244, as has been shewn by his coin.
In A.D. 248 the games, which had been transferred for a time to the
Circus Maximus, were again celebrated here.

In A.D. 238-44, we learn that the number of wild beasts kept in Rome for
the use of the amphitheatre during the time of the Emperor Gordianus
was as follows: 32 elephants, 10 elks, 60 tame lions, 10 tigers, 30
leopards, 10 hyenas, 1 hippopotamus, 1 rhinoceros, 10 wild lions, 10
camelopards, 20 wild asses, 40 wild horses, and many other wild animals,
besides two thousand hired gladiators[128]. All these, the Chronicler
adds, were exhibited or slain by Philippus, at the Ludi Sæculares which
he celebrated with great pomp for the thousandth[129] anniversary of the
foundation of Rome, A.D. 248, when he had gladiatorial and wild-beast
exhibitions in the amphitheatre[130].

Herodian[131], the Greek historian, writing about the middle of the
third century, says that a hundred lions, killed in the amphitheatre
by Commodus, appeared to leap out from under the earth. More strictly
speaking, they came from under the sand on the stage, as they were sent
up in cages which opened at the top, and naturally sprang out as soon as
liberty was given to them.

In A.D. 250, another fire took place under Decius, but the damage was
speedily repaired.

In A.D. 280, the Emperor Probus in his triumphal shows again had a
hundred lions killed in the amphitheatre[132].

In A.D. 320, the amphitheatre was again damaged by lightning, but was
soon restored by Constantine[133]. An attempt was made, A.D. 325, to
abolish the barbarous combats, and the exposure of convicts, but this
was not effected until the martyrdom of Telemachus, an Oriental monk,
A.D. 403, who made a pilgrimage from the East on purpose to be martyred
here, and during one of the sanguinary shows he rushed into the midst,
and falling on his knees, entreated the spectators to have mercy on their
victims. He was immediately stoned to death, but so great a sensation
was caused by this martyrdom, that the emperor Honorius was able to take
advantage of it to suppress the shows.

In A.D. 357, the amphitheatre is described by Ammianus Marcellinus as
perfect, and as a marvellous work, from its great height, and its immense
size. He also mentions the massive walls of rough stone, or concrete
(_moles_), bound together by travertine (_lapis tiburtinus_)[134].

A.D. 445. The amphitheatre was much repaired by the Prefect Rufus Cecina
Felix Lampadius, under Theodosius II. He restored the seats, the arena,
and the _podium_, as appears from an inscription[135] dug up on the spot
in 1814, and fixed on the wall within the building to preserve it. These
repairs are supposed to have been required in consequence of the damage
done during the siege by the Goths under Alaric, or more probably from
the effect of the earthquake mentioned by Paulus Diaconus[136] as taking
place in that year, when he says that many of the great buildings in Rome
were damaged.

A.D. 508. The Prefect Venantius Basilius also repaired the arena and the
_podium_, which had been damaged by an earthquake[137].

It was again used for the show of wild beasts under Theodoric in A.D.
519[138], and under Anicius Maximus, A.D. 523. These were the last
occasions on which we have any mention of these savage exhibitions.
In the beginning of the eighth century it appears to have been still
perfect, from the well-known proverb preserved in Bede’s _Excerptiones
patrum, Collectanea_, &c.; that the Colosseum and Rome would stand or
fall together[139]; but during that century it was again seriously
damaged by an earthquake, and it was then so much in ruins that it was
not used until the eleventh, when it was converted into a fortress, and
the southern side is said to have been much damaged by Robert Guiscard
and his Normans, but more probably by the travertine stone being carried
away for building materials.

In 1130, it became the chief fortress of the Frangipani family, and Pope
Innocent II. took refuge here from the anti-pope Anacletus[140].

In 1142, the Roman people had driven out the barons, and had possession
of this with their other fortresses, as appears from the records of the
Roman Senate at that period[141]. But the Frangipani[142] soon recovered
it, and the pope of their party, Innocent III., A.D. 1180 (called by
the opposite party the anti-pope), was their guest; and from hence he
fulminated his excommunication against the emperors, but he was soon
afterwards captured and banished.

In 1160, Alexander III.[143] (Bandinelli of Siena, called the orthodox
Pope) in his second year, being besieged by the Emperor Frederic
Barbarossa, abandoned the Lateran Palace, and took refuge in the
stronghold of the Frangipani, with his brothers and their families. He
there held courts, treated causes, and also waited for opportunities.
At that time the Colosseum gave its name to the district around it. The
fortifications included part of the Palatine Hill, with the Arch of
Titus, on which was a large tower.

Under Gregory IX., A.D. 1227, the Annibaldi family obtained a decree
from Frederic II., requiring the Frangipani to cede to them one-half of
the Colosseum fortress, which might have led to its entire destruction;
but Innocent IV., in 1244, rescinded the engagement, and declared
this building to be under the direct dominion of the Holy See. During
the residence of the Popes at Avignon, the Colosseum belonged to the
Annibaldi or Annibaldeschi, who were then in the ascendant[144]. In 1312,
the Emperor Henry VII. obliged them to give it up, and placed it under
the care of the municipality, who appropriated it to bull-fights; but
this only lasted until 1332, when eighteen youths of noble families were
killed by the infuriated bulls, of which a minute account is given in the
chronicle of Monaldeschi, printed in Muratori’s collection[145].

In 1349, it was again damaged by the earthquake described in Petrarch’s
letters; after this the great families entered into a compact, in
1362, to make the ruins common property as a quarry, by which all might
profit[146]. In 1381, the senate gave a portion of the arcades to the
Chapter of the Lateran, for a ward to their hospital. Their badge, the
head of Christ between two candlesticks, is carved over some of the
archways.

In 1438, Eugenius IV. built two walls to connect the Colosseum with the
monastery of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in order to prevent the evil doings
that were going on there; but after the death of that Pope, the Roman
people went in a crowd and pulled down those walls which had shut them
out of the great building. The monks stated to Flaminius Vacca that they
had preserved the deed of gift, and if they ever had a pope from their
monastery, it would be acted upon[147].

In the fifteenth century, the great palace of S. Mark of Venice, built
by Paul II., 1464-1471, at the south end of the Corso, the Farnese in
1534, the Cancelleria in 1495, the Borghese in 1590, and many other
edifices[148], were built out of this quarry.

In the sixteenth century it was used for miracle plays; this practice
began under Paul III. in 1540[149], a purpose to which it had previously
been applied on Good Friday in each year by the “Confraternity of the
Gonfalone;” this is mentioned as early as 1263.

We have one vestige of this remaining, a view of Jerusalem with the
Crucifixion, painted on the wall over the principal entrance then in use
at the north end over the arch, and seen in going out as we look up. It
shews to what a height the earth had then been raised to make this a
convenient place for such a picture.

Sixtus V. proposed to turn it into a cloth manufactory, and drawings for
that purpose were actually prepared by his architect, Fontana[150], in
1590; but the design was abandoned at the death of the Pope.

In 1703 it was again damaged by an earthquake, and soon afterwards
Clement XI. destroyed the lower arches of the western side of the
corridor, and used some of the stone to build the steps at the Port
of Ripetta, on the Tiber. He employed other parts as a warehouse for
saltpetre for the neighbouring manufactory of gunpowder, on the hill
adjoining, near the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, still indicated by
the name of the street, and this manufactory continued in use until 1811.

In 1728, Benedict XIII. consecrated the whole area, at the instigation of
a Carmelite friar, Angelo Paoli. A small chapel was made under one of the
archways, and dedicated to _S. Maria della Pietà_. In 1741, a hermit was
appointed to reside here, but in the following year he was stabbed by an
assassin, and although the wound did not prove fatal, the Pope ordered
the closing of every ingress by gates locked and barred. About the same
period, Leonardo da Porto Maurizio, a Minorite friar, drew immense
congregations to his sermons in the Colosseum.

In 1749, Benedict XIV. ordered the erection at his private expense
of the central cross, and the fourteen stations of the _Via Crucis_,
which remained until 1874, when they were removed for the ground to be
excavated.

In 1756, a grand mass was celebrated here by the Cardinal Vicar of Rome
under Benedict, in the presence of a very numerous assembly. The same
ceremony was repeated a few years afterwards under Clement XIII.

The outer arcade on the south-western side of this colossal building was
entirely destroyed in the middle ages by the Pontifical families, who
used it as a stone-quarry for building their great palaces. This enables
us to see more clearly the construction of the walls of the corridors and
front of the three periods:—

    First, the arches on the ground-floor, built of travertine.

    Second, the first-floor, also of travertine, not long after the
    other.

    Third, the upper storey, of brick on the inner side, of the
    beginning of the third century.

We also see the numerous holes left by the iron clamps with which the
edges of the stones were bound together, according to a Roman fashion
which has been in use from the time of Servius Tullius to the present
time. On the north-eastern side the front is perfect, and we see the
ornamental columns and cornices in the two lower storeys, and in the
upper one the corbels for the masts to carry the awning, with holes in
the cornice to let them pass through. One of the arches of the lower
storey has been restored in the time of the Gordians, A.D. 220-238, and
is a good example of the still good construction of that period, though
not so good as that of the time of Titus and Vespasian[151].

In 1810, when Rome was incorporated in the French Empire, the Governor,
Baron Daru, placed the Colosseum under the direction of the Roman
architect Valadier, to carry on regular excavations, which were
continued for four years, from 1810 to 1814; of these works the Comte de
Tournon[152], then prefect, has written an account.

In 1812, under the French, the ruins of the walls and the surface of the
vaults were weeded of the vegetation which threatened their ultimate
destruction, and the uprooting of the shrubs had become necessary to save
the walls. In sixty years they had again grown up so vigorously that
another weeding was absolutely required, and in November, 1870, the whole
of the ruins of the Colosseum were cleared of weeds and shrubs, under the
direction of Signor Rosa, who was appointed by the Italian Government to
superintend the works, and to carry on excavations on a large scale, from
that building to the Forum Romanum. There is no doubt that it was quite
time this clearing should take place, as the roots of the plants were
in many parts displacing the stones, and would soon have done serious
mischief. There was a great outcry against this necessary work by the
botanists and the lovers of the picturesque, but archæologists must
approve of it. Many things are now brought into view more clearly than
they were before.

A view of these excavations was taken and engraved in 1813. It
represents clearly the passages round it, and two straight parallel
channels down the middle of it for the naval fights, which were in
reality not a representation of sea-fights but of river-fights. In 1814,
and again in 1867, the subterranean passage leading from the Amphitheatre
on the side next the Cœlian was excavated as a private speculation in
search of treasure, which was not found; but the passage was left open as
we now see it[153].

In 1864-5, considerable excavations were made between the Colosseum and
the Cœlian, in search of treasure supposed to have been buried there,
but only a subterranean passage was found. The work was interrupted by
water gushing out in great abundance,—to such an extent that the area of
the Colosseum was completely inundated, and the water was obliged to be
drawn off by a steam engine[154]. The passage then discovered is still
left open; the upper part of the vault only is removed, which formed the
floor, or rather supported the floor, of another passage on the present
level of the ground, leading from the _podium_, or lowest storey, towards
the Cœlian. The point where the water gushed out and stopped the work
was just outside of the site of the outer wall, long since destroyed on
that part of the building. The great excavations of 1874 shewed that
this passage turned to the left or south when it reached the outer wall,
and followed the line of it until it joined the outer end of the long
straight passage down the centre of the building.

The upper wall on the north side, where it remains perfect, formed the
back of the wooden gallery over the corridors for the common people, and
was faced with brick, but the greater part of the ancient brickwork had
fallen down, and has been copied in modern times; a great deal of the
back of the stone wall, left exposed, shews the hasty construction[155],
in the time of Gordianus.

The remains of Aqueducts and _Piscinæ_ have already been mentioned[156],
but some further account of them seems to be requisite. A _piscina_
always consists of four vaulted chambers, two above and two below,
and the middle wall of the two lower chambers has small holes in it,
for straining the water as it passes through. The lower chamber of a
_piscina_ is also known by having no windows in it, and the lining
being of the water-cement (_opus signinum_). The lower chambers of two
_piscinæ_ only remain; of the northern one the middle wall between the
two lower chambers is the only part now visible, this is faced with
_opus reticulatum_ of the time of Nero, and has the usual small holes
for water-pipes through the wall. The southern one is of brickwork of
the third century, of the time of Alexander Severus; of this there is
much more remaining, one end with the usual boldly projecting buttresses
to support the weight of water, and part of two other chambers of the
reservoir.

The excavations which had been made in the time of the first Napoleon and
of Pope Pius VII., 1810-1814, were filled up again after drawings and
plans had been made of them. They were not considered satisfactory by
scholars because the excavations had not gone deep enough, having been
stopped by water, as very often happens in Rome at certain periods of the
year, when the springs are high. They were again suspended by the same
cause in the spring and summer of 1874, but Signor Rosa, with his usual
energy, obtained machinery and a steam-engine to pump the water out[157].
The whole area was found to be undermined by chambers and passages, with
walls chiefly of brick, but some of tufa, with indications of several
different periods[158].

When the Pontifical Government returned to power in 1815, Pope Pius VII.
ordered the enormous buttress to be built, for supporting one end of the
wall then left broken, and preventing the ruin from extending further.
We have already lost forty-seven out of the eighty arches, which have
been destroyed for using the materials by previous Popes to build their
family palaces, or monasteries and churches, so that there remain only
thirty-three of the external arches of travertine. The other end of the
wall, near the Meta Sudans, was left in a dangerous state until that
was also supported by the great buttress of Leo XII. In 1828, Gregory
XVI. followed the example of his immediate predecessors, and rebuilt
in brick some arches of what had been the internal corridors, but had
become external, owing to the demolition of the great outer arcades in
earlier ages. In 1852, Pius IX. repaired the principal entrance from the
Esquiline side, and some more of the arches of the inner arcade.

Under the arena was all the machinery usual under the stage of a large
theatre; and much space was required for it. When the boards had to be
cleared off the central part, to leave open the four long channels of
water, which are seen in the view of the Colosseum taken in 1812[159],
and the space between them which was probably flooded to the depth of a
few feet for effect, the boards removed from the centre must have been
piled up at the sides, and on the large corbels before mentioned[160].
Apollodorus, the architect, in his celebrated reply to the Emperor
Hadrian, told him that _he ought to have_ prepared a place for the
machinery of the great amphitheatre under the platform, and in such a
manner that the great building should have been visible from the Forum
Romanum. The site intended by him for the temple evidently was the large
level platform on the Summa Sacra Via, on which S. Francesca Romana now
stands; and the place for the machinery intended by him was obviously
that excavated in the spring of 1874, under the south-east end of the
platform immediately opposite to the Colosseum, a very convenient place
for the purpose. There still remains a rude rubble vault, of the time of
the Republic, with a small aqueduct introduced in the time of the early
Empire to carry water to the fountains at each corner of the Porticus
Liviæ, which must have been on this site, but which did not extend to
the end. There is an excellent place for a temple at the end of the
_porticus_ or colonnade; and the platform could easily have been extended
several yards nearer to the Colosseum: it is evident that this is what
Apollodorus said that Hadrian _ought to have done_, but that he had not
done so.

At the south-east end, under the old entrance, at the present level of
the ground, a long passage has been found, with a series of square-topped
arches, at about fifteen feet below that level. This has been traced
further to the south, beyond the limits of the building; it must have
led from the great foss-way in that direction. There is a large and deep
drain extending from the south end of the Colosseum, turning at an angle
and passing at the foot of the Claudium to the Meta Sudans, near the arch
of Constantine. It was continued under the present Via di S. Gregorio,
and the south-east end of the Palatine[161].

In one part, near the south end, on the western side of the central
passage at the lowest level, which is twenty-one feet below the present
level of the ground and the top of the walls of the substructure, the
two ancient tufa walls (before mentioned) remain nearly perfect, with
the vertical grooves opposite to each other, evidently for lifts to
slip up and down, and in each instance in the wall on one side a hollow
is cut, for the counter-weight to work up and down[162]. These lifts
are very near together in the outer passage, in front of the _podium_,
but far below the bottom of it. Behind each of them is a small square
chamber under the passage in front of it, with a narrow entrance to
it, and a small stream of water running in front for the use of the
animals, as these are plainly the dens for the wild beasts to be placed
in temporarily, and there is just space enough for the animal to pass
through into the wooden cage (_pegma_[163]), which had two doors, one
at the side, the other at the top. When the cage on the lift was pulled
up to the level of the floor of the stage or arena, under one of the
trap-doors, the upper part was pulled up by a cord from below along with
the trap-door, and the animal thus placed at liberty sprang out on to the
stage. In the original pavement, which remains round a great part in the
passages, behind the place for each of the lifts, is a round hole for
the socket of a pivot to work in, evidently for the windlass for winding
up the cord[164]. It is calculated that there was one of these lifts in
front of each arch, and a den behind each, all round the _enceinte_ of
the building, so that all the wild beasts could spring on to the stage
at once with tremendous effect. The persons in the lower gallery were
protected by strong nets, and by bars that turned round on pivots, so
that the claws of wild beasts had no hold upon them.

Under the long passage which comes in at the south end is a large drain
at a considerably lower depth; there are gratings in the paved floor of
the passage above opening into it, which had unfortunately been stopped
up in some of the great floods, but was partially cleared out as far as
the Meta Sudans in 1875. The paved floor of the passage over the drain
under the arena is three feet above the level of the pavement, which
is of herring-bone brickwork (_opus spicatum_), and the passage before
mentioned goes all round the building nearly under the edge of the
_podium_. Modern iron steps have been placed for people to descend to the
bottom of the building, and under these is seen the ancient iron grating
to prevent anything being carried off by the rush of water[165]. From
this it is evident that the great drain was to carry off the water used
in the canals for the _naumachia_, when the Emperor “ordered the water
to be let off and the boards to be replaced.” There are evident marks of
a great flood-gate or sluice drawn up, as a portcullis, at the entrance
to this drain. It also appears that the vessels were floated down on the
wooden framework on which they were dragged along, now made visible, but
it does not appear that they could have been floated up also to the level
of the canals. The space between the wooden floor of the _stage_, called
the arena, and the original pavement being twenty-one feet, the canals
were ten feet deep, and yet room is left for the passages and machinery
under them. Possibly, but not probably, the whole central space could be
floated, excepting just at the south end, where room was left for the
machinery. The vessels were probably never removed from the building, but
left under the vaults, and dragged out when required.

The tufa walls with the grooves for lifts belong to the earliest part of
the building, and must be earlier than the time of Nero[166], as has been
shewn; and his _stagnum navale_, or _naumachia_, his _venationes_, or
wild-beast hunts, and gymnasium, which are recorded as belonging to his
great palace, could have been nowhere else but on this spot.

We now see distinctly the large corbels[167] all round the building at
a certain height, about six feet below the present level of the soil,
for carrying the boards of the great floor covered with sand called the
arena, upon which the athletes wrestled, the wild beasts were killed, and
the persons condemned to death were torn to pieces by wild beasts; so
that the martyrdom of the early Christians who were condemned to death in
this manner took place on the sand of the _arena_, and not on the soil
of the _area_. These corbels, in some instances, at the south end of
the building, have the ends of them built into the old tufa wall, which
is cut away to receive them. This old wall is not so regular in plan as
the great work of the Flavian Emperors, the architect of which probably
intended to destroy these old walls ultimately. Dio Cassius (himself a
Roman senator) gives a vivid description of scenes which took place in
this Amphitheatre[168] in his presence, in the time of Commodus (as
has been said), which leaves no doubt about the matter. Similar scenes
are described in the time of Nero. The whole of the arena was, in fact,
supported in all directions by the walls of the chambers or passages not
more than ten feet apart; one object of which, no doubt, was to carry the
great boarded floor, that could be removed at pleasure by the order of
the emperor, and replaced as readily[169].

The excavations of 1874 and 1875[170] very much astonished the people
in Rome, and more especially the English visitors, who had been long
accustomed to consider the _area_ and the _arena_ to be the same thing;
they were amazed to see the whole of the area undermined with walls[171].
The walls that were first seen are for the most part brick walls of the
fifth century, and the inscription[172] found there in 1814 records that
they had been repaired by Lampadius, prefect, A.D. 442. This was after
they had been much damaged by an earthquake. Another inscription records
repairs of the _arena_ and the _podium_ by Basilius, prefect and consul,
A.D. 508, after another earthquake. A long subterranean passage[173] at
a considerable depth, leads out at the south-east end in the direction
of the church of S. Clement; this passage passes under a number of
square-topped arches or doorways, and has rather the appearance of having
been a state entrance at the time that the level of the street was as
low as that passage, that is, before the filling-up of the foss-ways,
which began in the second century. On each side of this passage is a long
narrow vaulted chamber parallel to it, under the corridor, and in the
pavement of each of these chambers is a series of six round holes lined
with hard copper or bronze, for a pivot to work in; they are somewhat
worn, and in a straight line one behind the other. The most probable use
for these was for a windlass or capstan to be worked in each, and by
these means to drag along the vessels in the canals before mentioned, as
extending down the centre of this colossal building.

It has also been mentioned that a very ancient wooden frame, calculated
for the keel of a vessel to slide upon, remained on the ground in 1875,
just within the passage at the south-east end of the building, as if
the vessels used in the sham fights could be placed out of sight in the
lofty central passage. This is said by those accustomed to dockyards to
have all the appearance of a dry dock, or a cradle for vessels to stand
upon[174]. We read of the vessels being divided into two nations or
sides, there were probably six on each side, and each nation occupied one
of the canals. It is probable that the surface between the two canals on
either side of this central passage, just under the level of the arena
(which was twenty-one feet above the brick floor), was flooded with two
or three feet in water, but the keels of the vessels were in the canals.
On either side of the passages before mentioned[175] are remains of other
walls of tufa, with vertical grooves in them, as if for lifts; the brick
walls, between those of tufa, have been introduced at a later period, and
in these instances the grooves are not opposite each other. This shews
that great alterations have been going on at different periods in these
subterranean works, some of which are earlier than the existing building,
and others considerably later[176]. In one place, near the south-east
entrance, the two old stone walls, with the vertical grooves, remain in
their original places facing each other, so that lifts might work up and
down in them.

Architects had long wondered where the builders could possibly have
obtained such an immense mass of materials in so short a time, it was
therefore evidently natural that they should make use of anything that
served their purpose. It appears that in some parts the galleries for
the spectators of the old Naumachia were thus made use of as they stood,
without actually rebuilding them. The great tufa blocks of the second
wall of Rome were also used as old materials for the substructure of the
great stone arcades; but the builders, who had to add the upper gallery,
were afraid to trust the soft tufa to carry so great a weight[177], and
therefore built piers of travertine about four feet wide[178]. These
piers to support the upper gallery go right through the walls of all the
lower galleries, from the top to the bottom of the building (as has been
said on p. 12).

The architectural details of the Colosseum are much admired by
architects; the cornice-mouldings of the lower storey are good examples
of the style of the latter part of the first century[179]. The supply of
water for the naval fights must have been from the Aqueducts; the water
was brought from the Cœlian in a shallow channel, carried upon a lofty
double colonnade, or arcade[180]. It has been mentioned[181] that there
are slight remains of three reservoirs to receive it, which can be traced
by remains of the particular cement used only for the aqueducts[182]. The
continuations of the shallow channel along the corridors can be seen in
many places, and are shewn in the photographs[183].

In the upper storey of the third century, on the exterior, the corbels
for the masts to rest upon, and the holes in the cornice for them to pass
through, have been mentioned[184]. On the interior of this wall, now that
it has been stripped of plaster, and the wooden gallery that had been
built up against it has been destroyed, we see clearly how hastily it has
been built of old materials[185]. In other parts it has been cased with
modern brickwork, but the corbels for fastening the masts on the inside
are preserved[186].


THE EVIDENCE OF THE CONSTRUCTION, AND COMPARISON.

It is well known that the first principle of the modern science of
archæology is comparison. To compare small remains of one place with
more perfect remains of the same kind, and as far as may be, of the same
period, in other places. By these means, what has been destroyed in one
is frequently supplied by the corresponding part in another. This is
remarkably the case with regard to the amphitheatres, which are very
numerous; there was one to every Roman town of importance, and such large
buildings have almost invariably left remains visible[187]. It appears
nearly certain that the Colosseum in Rome was the earliest, and that
this was the type generally followed more or less closely by the others.
This was a gradual development, and not merely one original design;
the magnificent front and stone corridors of the Flavian emperors,
which constitute what is usually considered to be the amphitheatre,
were in fact built round a theatre previously existing[188]; that the
names of theatre or amphitheatre were used indifferently is implied
in many instances, and is distinctly shewn by an inscription found in
the Colosseum itself, and preserved on the spot, in which it is called
_theatrum_, and not _amphitheatrum_[189]. The theatre, or amphitheatre,
round which the corridors were built, has been shewn to have been in
parts of the time of Nero[190], and other parts earlier, most probably
the work of Scaurus in the time of Sylla[191]. This colossal building was
finished and consecrated by Titus in the year 80[192].


CAPUA.

The great amphitheatre at Capua is almost of the same size as the
Colosseum in Rome, and a remarkably exact copy of it; some say that it
was called by the same name, but this is rather doubtful, as persons
who have resided at Capua for years say they have never heard it so
called; the name is not of much importance: the plan and arrangements
are identical, and although the superstructure has been almost entirely
destroyed, the substructures at Capua are far more perfect than in Rome;
and here we have the mouth of an aqueduct perfect in these substructures,
and remains of canals for water, with the very massive walls to support
them, exactly as in Rome. The great drain to carry off the water also
remains, but on rather a different plan; instead of being carried under a
low arch at the end of the great central passage, as in Rome, the water
is conveyed into a large and deep well in the centre of the building,
with four small channels running into it, beside the great central
opening. From this well there is a large and deep drain leading to the
river. There are the same dens for wild beasts under the _podium_, and
in the pavement the same sockets for pivots to work in, to pull up the
cages, or _pegmata_, or lifts. The arena, instead of being a boarded
floor, is of brick, carried on vaults, with numerous square apertures
for the trap-doors. The central passage is vaulted at the two ends, but
open in the greater part. Round each of the openings there is a deep
groove, as if a wooden cover had been fitted tightly over each and made
water-tight, so that the surface of the arena might be flooded for naval
fights; but there is reason to believe that only rowing-boats, drawing
little water, were used in this instance, and not galleys.

The earliest part of the building at Capua is of the time of the Emperor
Hadrian, but only a small part of that period remains, as shewn by the
construction (reticulated work with a framework of brick). Most of the
walls in the substructure are faced with brick of the second or third
century, with later repairs[193].


PUTEOLI OR POZZUOLI.

This amphitheatre is very much smaller than either the Colosseum in
Rome, or the amphitheatre at Capua; the superstructure is in a very
ruinous state, but the substructure is almost perfect, and the work
is much more highly finished than in either of the others. There are
considerable remains of rich stucco ornament on the vault over the
passage to one of the side doors. The arena is nearly intact, and is of
brick, carried on vaults, what the Italians call _pensile_; this word
does not mean literally hanging, but hollow underneath; and this brick
floor is full of square holes for trap-doors; round the edge of each is
a deep groove, as if for a cover to fit into, which may very well have
been made water-tight. Signor Scherillo, a native of Pozzuoli, and now a
canon of the cathedral at Naples, has published several papers on this
amphitheatre in the _Atti dell’ Accademia di Archeologia, Letteratura e
belle Arti di Napoli_. He is of opinion that the arena was flooded to the
depth of about three feet, or about half way up the _podium_; the water
would only cover the two or three lower steps, and there were probably
also water-tight doors at the foot of them. At a short distance in front
of the _podium_ is a channel about a foot deep, in which probably a beam
of wood has lain, and at intervals of ten or twelve feet is a square
hole, evidently for a beam of wood to have stood in, no doubt the lower
part of the frame for the netting to keep off the wild beasts from the
people in the lower gallery, as in the Colosseum, and probably carried
up as poles or masts to receive the lower ends of the cords to carry
the awning; there are also remains at the top of the outer wall of the
same arrangement of fixing the masts there as in the Colosseum, and the
same thing can be seen in many other amphitheatres where the outer wall
remains perfect. This amphitheatre is entirely of the time of Hadrian,
a beautiful piece of construction. It seems to have been a favourite
show-place of the Emperors on state occasions, for the upper classes
and foreigners, when the fleet was assembled in the Bay of Naples, in
which the Cape of Misenum is one of the promontories near this spot.
The enormous reservoir of water for the supply of the fleet, called the
_Piscina Mirabilis_, is also not far off; and the amphitheatre belonged
to the great imperial villa, originally of Nero, in the bay adjoining.

This amphitheatre has been shamefully used in the Middle Ages, the arena
having been made into a cabbage garden, with a deep bed of earth upon
it. The upper parts of the walls had probably been damaged by the great
earthquake, and in order to get rid of the numerous broken columns and
capitals lying about, the gardeners threw them down the openings into
the vaults below, where they are stacked up under the arches like so
many mere blocks of stone, to put them out of the way. Fortunately it
is owing probably to the vaults having thus been made use of, that they
have been so well preserved, and also because there was not much call for
building-stone in the neighbourhood, as the ruins of the villa and the
temples had supplied as much as was wanted.


VERONA.

In many of the Italian cities, as well as in Gaul and Britain, the
amphitheatre was made of earth and wood only, the seats cut out in banks
on the slope of a hill or of an _agger_, in districts where stone was
scarce. In the Circus Maximus also the seats for the _plebs_ on the
Aventine seem to have been made in that manner, the stone galleries were
on the Palatine only.

At VERONA, as in many other instances, the outer wall has been almost
entirely destroyed; two bays, or four arches of it only remain, but these
are sufficient to shew the plan, and that it was three storeys high,
the Tuscan order of columns being used throughout. The upper storey
seems to have been for the passage round the seats over the corridors;
the two lower ones with the seats remain nearly perfect, forming a fine
double arcade on the outer side without columns, now made visible by the
demolition of the outer corridor and wall. In its present state it is
one of the finest buildings of its class. There seems to be no historical
evidence of its date; in Murray’s Handbook it is said to be of the time
of the Flavian Emperors, but no authority for this is given, and it is
not probable. The measurements given by Maffei do not _quite_ agree with
those taken by Alvino[194], but the variations are not great; and as one
is taken in Neapolitan palms of ten inches, the other in Veronese feet,
the apparent variation probably arose only from the different mode of
calculating. None of them agree with those in Murray’s Handbooks, which
are taken from the Lectures of Mr. Woods. The general proportions may
be judged of by the number of persons that each would contain; Publius
Victor states that the Colosseum had 87,000 places, and Maffei states
that this at Verona had 77,000, this would make it one-eighth less.
The variations are not of much importance. The outer wall was partly
destroyed by an earthquake in 1184, and the stones were then used as
building material, as in other places, but this was soon stopped. The
unusually perfect state of the seats arises from the care taken of them
in the Middle Ages, very much to the credit of the inhabitants at that
period. As early as 1228, it was agreed that each _podesta_ (or mayor)
should expend 500 lire (about £20[195]) on the repairs of this building;
and in 1435 penalties were inflicted on any one who removed any of the
stone. This shews that the people of Verona were more civilized than the
Romans at that period. In 1545 a special officer was appointed to take
charge of it. The restoration of the seats has been carefully done, and
is not perceived without some examination. This restoration was begun by
voluntary subscription as early as 1568, and continued as late as 1805.
The arches were numbered on the exterior, as in the Colosseum; the four
that remain have the numbers LXIIII to LXVII over them. The arrangement
of the masts and poles for the awning are the same as in Rome, and were
managed in the same manner. The plan of the _vomitoria_ is also nearly
the same. No excavations appear to have been made _under_ the arena; a
plan and section of the substructures under the galleries is given by
Maffei, they are similar to those in Rome. He does not appear to have
been aware that there was likely to have been anything under the arena;
he mentions the conduits of aqueducts, and drains for carrying off the
water, which seem to shew that _naumachia_ were held here, but we have no
information as to how they were managed.

The proportions of the three principal amphitheatres, as given in the
work of Alvino[196], in Neapolitan palms[197] of ten inches are:—

                              | Colosseum. | Verona. | Capua.

THE AMPHITHEATRE AT POLA, IN ISTRIA.

This fine structure is built of beautiful white stone, almost marble,
in large blocks without mortar, but it had metallic fastenings, which
have all disappeared, and left their marks behind them. There are two
rows of arches, and above a line of square windows; also a curious stone
parapet, with very distinct indications of arrangement for spreading the
_velarium_ or _vela_ (the awning). There is only one line of columns,
but there was originally a second, and most of the bases of them are
still _in situ_. The amphitheatre is built against a rocky mountain,
which causes the northern part of the ellipse to be much lower than the
outer one. There are numerous passages and substructures, except on the
rocky half of the building. There are two principal entrances facing
each other, and in a line with them is a trench exactly similar to the
one in the Colosseum, and at Capua, &c. These canals for conducting
water into the arena can still be seen, and there seems no doubt of its
having been used for _naumachia_. There are but few remains of the seats,
except a large accumulation of _débris_, and traces of the stairs and
_vomitoria_. The whole line of the _podium_ is also perfectly preserved,
but no trace of the concentric _euripus_ found in other amphitheatres.
The most puzzling parts of the structure are four rectangular towers,
which appear to have had no special staircases leading to them from the
ground; antiquaries, with all their ingenuity, have not yet given any
satisfactory explanation of these objects. They were most probably for
the music, as in the circus of Maxentius on the Via Appia, near Rome,
where one tower remains at each end of the _carceres_[199].

The amphitheatre at Nîmes, in Aquitaine, still has a wooden floor with
trap-doors in it; the present floor is not ancient, but no doubt replaces
an old one; there is no staircase, and the only access to the passages
below is by a step-ladder, and the arrangement of the substructures
is quite different from that in Rome, or at Capua, or Puteoli. There
are large masses of stone at intervals to support the floor, and wide
passages between them. On two of these massive piers are inscriptions,
with the name of the architect, the same inscription repeated twice, in
characters of the third century. There are no signs of _naumachia_, or of
aqueducts; the seats and the superstructure are more perfect than usual,
and have a very fine effect.

At Arles the superstructure also is very grand, but there are no
substructures under the arena visible. It is partly cut out of the rock,
the lower part supported by massive substructures, but no passages in
them are visible. Excavations have not been made there, and the doorways
appear to be filled up to half their height, as at the Porta Tiburtina in
Rome.

At Bordeaux the ruins of the amphitheatre are called the (_arènes_)
arena, and it evidently had a boarded floor covered with sand, as in the
Colosseum; and the superstructures, with the seats, are more perfect
than in Rome. There is a great general resemblance, but the details are
not the same. The Colosseum is the only amphitheatre which has _double_
corridors round it, and the absence of this outer passage makes a
different arrangement of the stairs to the _vomitoria_ necessary in this
and other amphitheatres, where the people went straight out through each
archway.


SUBSTRUCTURES COMPARED.

In treating of the amphitheatres in general, and corroborating the
account given in this work of the Colosseum, it must be borne in mind
that in every theatre a considerable space is required behind the scenes
for the use of the actors. The performances in an amphitheatre would
equally require such space for the performers when off the stage, and
the only space to which they could possibly retire is under that stage
which is called the _arena_, because it was covered with sand; and it has
been shewn that in these substructures there are numerous passages and
contrivances for the machines to send up the wild beasts to be hunted,
the men and the dogs to hunt them, and the athletes for the wrestling
matches; we have also canals for water for the keels of the vessels, in
some instances, but not in all; in some cases, the vessels employed could
only have been rowing-boats, _rates_. We have also mention of battles
with swords in the _naumachia_, and of many men being killed. This seems
to make it clear that the principal amusement consisted in the crew of
one vessel trying to board the other, and the defendants preventing their
doing so in every way that they could, either by throwing them off into
the water, or with swords and spears.

At Pozzuoli, where the substructures are nearly perfect, there are
remains of an intermediate passage, as if for men to run along; and this
has been traced to communicate with the Emperor’s seat, and is thought
to have been for messengers to go with orders, and to give the necessary
directions. All that remains of this intermediate passage are the corbels
for carrying a wooden gallery upon. There are similar corbels for an
intermediate passage between two floors in the Colosseum, but here in the
upper part, apparently for the sailors to run along to furl or unfurl the
awning, not in the substructures; there also appear to have been separate
stairs and _vomitoria_ for that passage, and as we know that several
hundred sailors were employed in the Colosseum, such an arrangement would
be quite necessary.

Mention has frequently been made of the great central passage, which
exists not only in the Colosseum, but in all other amphitheatres where
substructures were made. This passage appears to have served for several
useful purposes; there are traces of machines in it for lifting up some
large object, not only in the Colosseum but also at Capua; and the things
to be lifted up in all probability must have been the vessels for the
naval fights. This central passage is mentioned or implied in several
instances in the classical authors; it had the appearance of a gulf
dividing the earth or _arena_ into two parts. Apuleius calls it _vorago
terræ_ (a gulf of the earth); Martial, the _via media_, or middle way;
and Petronius, _ruina terræ_, from the appearance of a swallowing-up the
machines and the gladiators.

The machines used for these public amusements were evidently numerous
and important, and required a good deal of space to stow them away, more
even than was afforded by the vaults and passages under the arena in
the Colosseum. This is implied by the celebrated letter of Apollodorus,
the architect, to the Emperor Hadrian, in which the architect told the
Emperor that he _ought to have_ built the Temple of Roma at the south end
of the Summa Sacra Via, and to have made room for this machinery of the
amphitheatre in vaulted chambers under it (as before mentioned); _that he
did not do so_ is evident, for the excavations of 1874 brought to light
rude concrete walls of the time of the Republic, with a small aqueduct
of the time of the Early Empire, made to carry water to the fountains
at the corners of the _porticus_ above. The accounts which we have in
classical authors, of the machinery employed in the amphitheatre, remind
us very much of that used for a Christmas pantomime in one of the London
theatres, and all these great shows were very much of the character of a
pantomime. To begin at the top, the cords which carried the _velarium_,
or awning, were strong enough for a rope-dancer, and were called by the
name of _catadromus_; and we have an account in Suetonius, in the time of
Nero, of an elephant being taught to walk upon these cords with a Roman
cavalier on his back[200]. We also have an account of an actor trying to
play the part of Icarus, and fly down from the top, falling dead at the
feet of Nero, and sprinkling him with his blood[201].

The _pegmata_ have been mentioned as cages for wild beasts, and this was
evidently one meaning of the word, as used by Seneca in his Epistles,
quoted in a previous page, but this was one meaning only; the same name
was applied to a wooden framework of any kind, sometimes evidently
what we now call scenery, either fixed or moveable. Josephus mentions
_pegmata_ used in the triumphal procession of Titus, one of which was
three storeys high, and another four, on which were representations
of the capture of Jerusalem. Another is mentioned by Calpurnius as
representing the Tarpeian rock[202], and the victims were thrown from
the top of it on to the arena, or into the gulf, and killed on the spot.
Apuleius also describes one as representing Mount Ida, with trees,
and shrubs, and fountains, on which appeared from time to time Paris
and Mercury, and the three goddesses, Juno, Pallas, and Venus, with a
number of animals to complete the scene[203]. Another is described by
Claudian as representing Mount Etna[204], with the flames burning at the
top. Others representing Vulcan and Cyclops; these were in the shows of
Carinus and Numerianus, and are mentioned by Vopiscus[205]. It is evident
that this scenery must have been prepared below and sent up from the
central passage, as there was no room anywhere else for sending it up.
Martial[206] also mentions _pegmata_ as rising, from this middle way,
and that a person could see from thence THE COLOSSUS among the stars. As
the Colossus stood on an elevated platform on the Summa Sacra Via, just
in a line with this middle way, and was itself 120 ft. high, it is quite
probable that the head of it could be seen from below, over the upper
gallery.

The dens for the wild beasts in the substructures under the _podium_ are
found both at Capua and at Pozzuoli, just as in the Colosseum, and the
technical name for such a den was _catabolus_[207]. Besides the mention
by Herodian of a hundred lions leaping on to the arena at once, as “if
out of the earth,” (mentioned in page 26), the same thing is mentioned by
several other authors at different periods, both of lions and of other
wild beasts. Vopiscus mentions this in the life of Probus[208], and that
all the doorways were stopped for a time; and he distinctly mentions the
animals coming out of the caves below. Ammianus Marcellinus[209] also
mentions the doorways being often stopped for the wild beasts. Statius
mentions the same[210], and Julius Capitolinus, both in the time of
Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. In each case a hundred lions are
mentioned, and in the latter that they were killed with arrows; and in
the time of Probus, not only a hundred lions, but also a hundred Lybian
leopards, a hundred Syrian ones, a hundred lionesses, and three hundred
bears. Lampridius[211] also mentions in the time of Gordianus the almost
incredible number of a thousand bears, in addition to a hundred Lybian
leopards.

To protect the people in the lower gallery from these wild beasts, a
strong netting was provided (as has been mentioned); this was of gold
wire, fixed in a wooden frame, and at the top was an ivory rod which
turned round, so that if an animal should attempt to cling to it, he
would necessarily fall back. This net was called _retia_, and at Puteoli
or Pozzuoli it was either of gold, or gilt; and this was the case in
the Colosseum also, and in other instances. Our authority for this is
Calpurnius in his Eclogues[212].

The naval fights with the larger vessels were sometimes held in the
Circus Maximus, which could be flooded to the depth required by stopping
up at the lower end the stream that runs through it, which is in fact a
branch of the small river Almo, but was in this part called the Euripus.
This name was also given to the canals for the _naumachia_, as in the
Colosseum. This must have been the case, because the Emperor Heliogabalus
upon one occasion filled these canals with wine, which could not have
been done in the Circus Maximus, where the Euripus was a natural running
stream of water; but in the Colosseum a canal supplied with water from
an aqueduct, which could be let in or drawn off at pleasure, might very
well have been filled with wine during an abundant season, when in Rome
the wine is sometimes worth less than the vessel that holds it, so that
large quantities are frequently wasted for want of casks to put it in.
In all wine-growing countries, the same thing occurs from time to time
in superabundant seasons. It is true that these naval fights were called
Circensian games, because they were sometimes held in a circus (as has
been said), but the same name was given to them when they were held in
the amphitheatre, as in this instance, by Lampridius[213]. Martial[214]
distinguishes very clearly both the one and the other, and makes it
evident that the _stagna_ of Nero were used for the _naumachia_ of the
Cæsars.

That the vaults under the arena were called _caveæ_, caves (or cavities),
has been already mentioned, and is evident from many passages in
classical and mediæval authors; as in Tertullian and in Prudentius[215],
when describing the scenes that had taken place in the amphitheatre as
the wicked rites in which the gladiators were killed on the arena, and
the impious games in which the sad spectacles of funereal character were
brought up from the caves, worthy only of the infernal Jupiter (whom the
Christians call Satan).


THE ARENA.

That one of the modes of putting criminals to death in Rome was to throw
them to the wild beasts to be torn to pieces on the arena, to glut the
savage taste of the Roman people, is notorious; but that many of the
gladiators and other actors were also frequently killed on the arena is
not so generally known, and yet the evidence for it is too distinct to be
doubted. Seneca mentions distinctly, in one of his Epistles[216], that
a number of the bodies were exposed to view, of men who were unable to
defend themselves by their swords or their shields. He justly says that
the men were as savage as the lions or the bears, and the usual end of
these fighting men was death on the arena. There is a representation of
them in a fine mosaic picture in the Villa Borghese, with the letter θ,
and others on two of the _graffiti_ found in the Colosseum in 1875[217].

It is well known that the Roman people sometimes called upon the emperor
to produce the most celebrated gladiators, who had been named in the
programme for the show. Horace[218] alludes to this in his Epistles; and
Martial[219] speaks of two of these gladiators, one called Myrinus, and
the other Triumphus (a name which has misled some of the commentators).
Another gladiator of that period was named Columbus, and was called for
by the people under Claudius, who promised that he should be exhibited if
he could be found, as is related by Suetonius[220]. Under Gordianus we
are told that thirty-two elephants, and about a thousand gladiators were
exhibited; it is probable that many of these were killed in the fight. It
has already been stated that Commodus fought himself with the gladiators
on the arena.

There was a particular costume for the athletes, and also for the emperor
when he went on to the arena, and Commodus gave offence by not complying
with the custom which had been established by Titus at the opening, as
is mentioned by Suetonius[221]. The carrying out of the dead bodies
from the arena is also mentioned by Quintilian[222] as done with pomp.
Lampridius[223] expressly says that Commodus acted contrary to the
established custom, and was not dressed in the proper manner; and that
his helmet was carried out of the theatre by the gate by which the dead
bodies were usually carried out, which was considered a bad omen, and he
was murdered soon afterwards. This is also mentioned by Dio Cassius (as
quoted on page 23).


THE GATES.

There were naturally four gates to this enormous structure, one at
each end, and one in the middle of each side; and the same arrangement
was followed in all the other amphitheatres. By what names these gates
were called, and whether these names were special for each particular
building, or general for all, is a question still undecided, and also
which was the state entrance. It is commonly said that in the Colosseum
the state entrance was on the northern side, next the Esquiline Hill,
because there is no number over that arch as there is over the other
arches, but this was probably the case with all the four entrances;
the other three gates are destroyed. The excavations in 1875 have been
supposed to shew that the passage on the southern side towards the
Cœlian did not lead direct to the palace of Commodus, but was carried
round the outer line of the building to the south-east end, near S.
Clemente; the natural entrance from the palace of Nero would be from
the gate at the east end, and not on the north side. The names of the
gates are not easily fixed; one was called Porta Libitinensis, and from
this door the bodies of those who were killed were carried out, as we
learn from Lampridius in the life of Commodus[224]. They were carried
out of this gate on a special bier provided for the purpose, called
_sandapila_, as is mentioned by Juvenal[225], and explained by the old
Scoliast. This name is sometimes written _sanavivaria_, as in the _Acta
Martyrum Felicita et Perpetua_[226]. The word _libitina_ signifies death,
or a funeral, or a bier; it is used also by Horace in his Odes[227],
and explained by the Scoliast in the same manner, and by Martial in
his Epigrams[228]. It appears that the name of _sandapilaria_ and
_libitinensis_ were synonymous. Another gate was called Porta Prætoria,
probably that at the south-east end, opening from the road to the
Vivarium at the Prætorian Camp. Another, Porta Sacra, probably that at
the north-west end, opening to the Via Sacra. The Meta Sudans was close
to this gate, and was supplied with water by tubes, as Seneca mentions in
his Epistles[229]. His fifty-seventh letter is full of lamentation for
the fate of the athletes.

The name of _cochlea_ is given to one of the doors of the amphitheatre,
which led from the _cavea_ to the arena. This name is used by Varro[230],
and has puzzled all the commentators; it need hardly be said that
_cochlea_ is literally “a snail,” and the name has been supposed to
apply to some narrow doorway; but the name is well known in mediæval
Latin as applied to a winding or newel staircase, popularly called a
corkscrew-staircase, and there are two such staircases leading from
the substructures or _cavea_ to the level of the arena, one on either
side, at the south-east end of the great central passage in the Flavian
amphitheatre, to which there can be no doubt that this name was applied.
Trajan’s column is frequently called _columna cochlea_, because there is
such a staircase inside of it.


THE GAMES IN THE ARENA.

The importance attached to the public amusements, both by the people and
by the emperors, appears extraordinary to modern ideas. Caligula[231] was
present from morning to evening, and had a series of the various kinds
of hunting in different countries exhibited, such as the hunts of the
Africans and of the Trojans; on these occasions, the arena was strewed
with red and green foliage. At this period Suetonius also mentions that
the people assembled at midnight for the shows of the following day,
when they were gratuitous[232]. The Emperor Claudius himself would go at
daybreak to the amphitheatre, and see the wild beasts fed, and again at
mid-day[233]. The same practice is mentioned by Pliny as used in the time
of Nero[234]. Petronius also mentions the custom for two old negroes to
sprinkle the arena with scents from small bottles, which they brought for
the purpose[235]. Tacitus gives an account of the games performed under
his own direction in the time of Claudius[236].

    “During the same consulship, in the year of Rome eight hundred,
    the secular games were celebrated, after an interval of
    sixty-four years since they were last solemnized in the reign
    of Augustus.

    “Being at that time one of the college of fifteen, and invested
    with the office of prætor, it fell to my province to regulate
    the ceremonies. Let it not be imagined that this is said from
    motives of vanity. The fact is, that in ancient times the
    business was conducted under the special directions of the
    quindecemviral order, while the chief magistrates officiated
    in the several ceremonies. Claudius thought proper to revive
    this public spectacle. He attended in the circus, and, in his
    presence, the Trojan game was performed by the youth of noble
    birth. Britannicus, the emperor’s son, and Lucius Domitius, who
    by adoption took the name of Nero, and afterwards succeeded to
    the empire, appeared, with the rest of the band, mounted on
    superb horses. Nero was received with acclamations, and that
    mark of popular favour was considered as an omen of his future
    grandeur.”




APPENDIX.


SCAURUS.

The meaning of the word Scaurus is “club-footed,” and no doubt the first
member of the family had that peculiar formation of the foot; but this
family was a branch of the great Gens Æmilia, one member of that family
built the Basilica Æmilia in the Forum Romanum, and another was one of
the second Triumvirate. The Scaurus who built this great amphitheatre
was a man of enormous wealth, and a great builder; he is mentioned by
several of his contemporaries, of whom one was Cicero; he was an ædile,
and was noted for his great liberality in his ædileship. His father was
an orator, and was consul in the year of Rome 688 (B.C. 35); his mother,
when a widow, married Sylla the dictator. Pliny mentions him several
times in his Natural History[237]; he calls his buildings _insane_
works, on account of the enormous sum expended upon them, which must
have exceeded the equivalent of two millions sterling of our money. The
temporary amphitheatre which he built would hold 80,000 persons, it was
three storeys high, and had 360 marble columns in it; these were on the
ground-floor, and it is mentioned that those on the first floor were of
glass[238], a luxury before unheard of (and apparently not repeated),
on the upper storey they were of gilt wood. Pliny thus describes this
building of Scaurus:—

    “Mosaic pavements were first introduced in the time of Sylla;
    at all events, there is still in existence a pavement[239],
    formed of small segments, which he ordered to be laid down
    in the Temple of Fortune, at Præneste. Since his time, these
    mosaics have left the ground for the arched roofs of houses,
    and they are now made of glass. This, however, is but a recent
    invention; for there can be no doubt that, when Agrippa
    ordered the earthenware walls of the hot baths, in the thermæ
    which he was building at Rome, to be painted in encaustic,
    and had the other parts coated with pargetting, he would have
    had the arches decorated with mosaic in glass, if the use of
    them had been known; or, at all events, if from the walls of
    the theatre of Scaurus, where it figured, as already stated,
    glass had by that time come to be used for the arched roofs of
    apartments. It will be as well, therefore, to give some account
    also of glass[240].”

    “It may possibly be observed, that this was because marble was
    not then introduced. Such, however, is not the fact; for in
    the ædileship of M. Scaurus, three hundred and sixty columns
    were to be seen imported, for the decorations of a temporary
    theatre, too, one that was destined to be in use for barely a
    single month. And yet the laws were silent thereon, in a spirit
    of indulgence for the amusements of the public, no doubt. But
    then, why such indulgence? or how do vices more insidiously
    steal upon us than under the plea of serving the public? By
    what other way, in fact, did ivory, gold, and precious stones,
    first come into use with private individuals?

    “Can we say that there is now anything that we have reserved
    for the exclusive use of the gods? However, be it so, let us
    admit of this indulgence for the amusements of the public;
    but still, why did the laws maintain their silence when the
    largest of these columns, pillars of Lucullan marble, as much
    as eight-and-thirty feet in height, were erected in the atrium
    of Scaurus? a thing, too, that was not done privately, or in
    secret; for the contractor for the public sewers compelled
    him to give security for the possible damage that might be
    done in the carriage of them to the Palace.... Already had L.
    Crassus, the orator, he who was the first to possess pillars of
    foreign marble, and in this same Palatium too, received from
    M. Brutus, on the occasion of a dispute, the nickname of the
    ‘Palatine Venus,’ for his indulgence in this kind of luxury.
    The material, I should remark, was Hymetian marble, and the
    pillars were but six in number, and not exceeding some twelve
    feet in height.... These particulars, and others in the sequel,
    will shew that we are so far improved; for who is there at the
    present day that has, in his atrium, any such massive columns
    as these of Scaurus[241]?” ...

    “I will not permit, however, these two Caiuses, or two Neros,
    to enjoy this glory even, such as it is; for I will prove that
    these extravagant follies of theirs have been surpassed, in
    the use that was made of his wealth by M. Scaurus, a private
    citizen. Indeed, I am by no means certain that it was not the
    ædileship of this personage that inflicted the first great blow
    upon the public manners, and that Sylla was not guilty of a
    greater crime in giving such unlimited power to his step-son,
    than in the proscription of so many thousands. During his
    ædileship, and only for the temporary purposes of a few days,
    Scaurus executed the greatest work that has ever been made
    by the hands of man, even when intended to be of everlasting
    duration; his theatre, I mean. This building consisted of
    three storeys, supported upon three hundred and sixty columns;
    and this, too, in a city which had not allowed without some
    censure one of its greatest citizens to erect six pillars of
    Hymetian marble. The ground-storey was of marble, the second
    of glass, a species of luxury which ever since that time has
    been quite unheard of, and the highest of gilded wood. The
    lowermost columns, as previously stated, were eight-and-thirty
    feet in height; and, placed between these columns, as already
    mentioned, were bronze statues, three thousand in number. The
    area of this theatre afforded accommodation for eighty thousand
    spectators; and yet the theatre of Pompey, after the city had
    so greatly increased, and the inhabitants had become so vastly
    more numerous, was considered abundantly large, with its
    sittings for forty thousand only. The rest of the fittings of
    it, what with Attalic vestments, pictures, and the other stage
    properties, were of such enormous value that, after Scaurus
    had conveyed to his Tusculan villa such parts thereof as were
    not required for the enjoyment of his daily luxuries, the loss
    was no less than three hundred millions of sesterces, when the
    villa was burnt by his servants in a spirit of revenge....
    C. Curio, who died during the civil wars, fighting on the
    side of Cæsar, found, to his dismay, that he could not, when
    celebrating the funeral games in honour of his father, surpass
    the riches and magnificence of Scaurus—for where, in fact,
    was to be found such a step-sire as Sylla, and such a mother
    as Metella, that bidder at all auctions for the property of
    the proscribed? Where, too, was he to find for his father, M.
    Scaurus, so long the principal man in the city, and one who
    had acted, in his alliance with Marius, as a receptacle for
    the plunder of whole provinces? Indeed, Scaurus himself was
    now no longer able to rival himself; and it was at least one
    advantage which he derived from this destruction by fire of so
    many objects brought from all parts of the earth, that no one
    could ever after be his equal in this species of folly. Curio,
    consequently, found himself compelled to fall back upon his own
    resources, and to think of some new device of his own.”

The points on which this account agrees with the Colosseum are so
remarkable, that there can hardly be a doubt that the enormous building
of Scaurus was on this site, and the old tufa walls of the substructure
must have belonged to his building. This was the earliest amphitheatre,
and in none of the other amphitheatres built in imitation of it do we
find similar old tufa walls, although in other respects some are exact
copies of the Colosseum.


AMPHITHEATRE OF NERO.

Some persons interpret a passage in the Annals of Tacitus[242] to mean,
that the amphitheatre of Nero was in the Campus Martius, but this is only
a wrong interpretation of the passage; he is speaking of the great wooden
amphitheatre which Julius Cæsar built there, and which was repaired and
restored to use in the second consulate of Nero (A.D. 56). He mentions
foundations and beams only, and especially says it was of little
importance. The time of Nero was a great building era in Rome, and he no
doubt repaired all the public buildings that required it.


THE GREAT DRAIN.

There is considerable difficulty at the present time (in 1876) in
obtaining correct information on the subject of the great drain, which
carried off the water from the substructures. The entrance to it from
the south-east end, under the entrance for animals, has been mentioned
before, with the sluice-gate, which lifted up like a portcullis, and
the grooves for it remain. Openings into it, covered with modern iron
gratings, are seen in the floor of the passage, and across the mouth of
it is an ancient iron grating. This great and deep drain carried the
water in a straight line beyond the outer wall of the building, and
just at this point a steam engine was placed in the years 1874 and 1875
to pump out the water, which gushed out of the earth a little further
on, in the direction of the church of S. Clement, with a divergence to
the south towards the Cœlian Hill. This water was very abundant, but it
appeared more like the continuous stream of an aqueduct than a natural
spring of water; it was at a very low level, quite 30 ft. underground. At
a considerably higher level, and near the surface of the ground, was an
aperture into the brick _specus_ or conduit of an aqueduct of the third
century, in which the water was flowing steadily along from west to east;
this continued all the summer of 1874, and the water was always flowing.
This aperture was closed in the summer of 1875, and the whole _specus_
buried again; where the water was sent to is not known to any one but the
persons employed, and they say that this water had little to do with the
other water which they pumped out, although both were always good clear
limpid streams of drinking water. The water was pumped out and conveyed
in an open channel, parallel to the building, to the Arch of Constantine,
where it made a small flood during all the spring of 1875, and was then
carried into a modern drain under the road between the Cœlian and the
Palatine, after passing over the road and washing the base of the Arch
of Constantine for several months. The old drain, at a great depth, was
traced the whole length of the Colosseum, parallel to it, close under
the foot of that part of the Cœlian Hill on which the Claudium stood,
and under which the two _piscinæ_, one of the time of Nero, the other of
Alexander Severus, have been mentioned. The workmen employed to clear
out the old drain were alarmed at the great depth; an enormous quantity
of earth had been thrown upon it, and they were afraid of its falling in
behind them, and blocking up their only mode of exit; deep wells were
made down into it, but after they had gone nearly as far as the Arch of
Constantine at this depth, they were stopped for want of air. Another
well, or air-pipe, was necessary, but the works were then all suspended
for want of funds. It is known that an ancient drain, at a great depth,
went under the road, and at a much lower level than a modern drain, which
passes near the monastery or church of S. Gregory on the Cœlian, between
that and the Palatine; and there can be little doubt that this was a
continuation of the same drain, and that it might all be cleared out and
repaired, but unless air-pipes can be put down by boring the expense
would be enormous.

Another small ancient drain has also been found coming from the Summa
Sacra Via, apparently for the fountains at the four corners of the
Porticus Liviæ. The workmen had been told that they were to find the
great drain passing under that part, and going on to the Cloaca Maxima
in the Forum Romanum, but this could not be found, and did not appear
practicable.

Father Mullooly, the excellent Prior of S. Clement, says he has observed
that the water under this church always rises and falls at the same time
as that under the Colosseum, and he is convinced that they both come
from the same source. It seemed probable that this source, or at least
one of the sources of this water, is the great reservoir of the earliest
aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, under the garden of the Villa Cœlimontana,
formerly called Villa Mattei, which is now the property of the Baron
Hoffman, at the west end of the Cœlian Hill, on a high level. The Baron
wanted to make this old vaulted reservoir into a wine-cellar, but found
it impossible to get rid of the water, which is always two or three
feet deep, and as fast as he pumped it out it filled again to the same
level, but no higher; this shews that there must be some outlet to it,
but so deep underground that no one knows which way it goes. This old
reservoir is nearly under the great reservoir of Nero for the Anio Novus,
which was fifty feet higher, and carried on his arches, for which also
the Arch of Dolabella was used as a substructure only. We have found in
our examination of the aqueducts that the later ones always followed
the same course as the earlier ones, not exactly over them, but by the
side of them, each succeeding aqueduct being always on a higher level,
and there is always a subterranean reservoir of one of the earlier
aqueducts nearly under those of the later period. The Appia was made
nearly four centuries before the Anio Novus, still it is very probable
that the same plan was followed in both cases. We have found that the
aqueduct of Claudius and Nero, called the Anio Novus, was divided into
three branches at this point; one went straight on over the Palatine
to the Capitoline Hill, another branch went to the left, or south, of
the Aventine, and a third to the right, or north, to the Colosseum. It
seems extremely probable that the same plan had been followed with the
Appia, both were carried along the high ground of the Cœlian Hill as
far as could be done, and then each was divided into three branches. We
traced one branch of it over the Porta Capena to the Aventine and the
Tiber; this is now necessarily out of use, the gate on the arch of which
it was carried having been destroyed. A landslip in the garden of the
Marchese Rappini, in February, 1876, between the Villa Cœlimontana and
the Palatine, served to shew that a _specus_ or conduit passed there,
now also out of use. An excavation was made there in April of the same
year, but all that came to light was a deep well, an ancient quarry of
tufa, also at a great depth, and the _specus_ of the aqueduct coming
from the reservoir under the Claudium, called a _vivarium_, and going in
the direction of the valley in which was the Porta Capena. This _specus_
has been long out of use, and could not have had any connection with the
flood in the Colosseum, which was the object of the search. The water
conveyed in this _specus_ originally must have been one of those that
passed over the short _agger_ of Servius Tullius from the Cœlian to the
Aventine, found in the excavation of 1868, and traced also in 1876 in the
cave under S. Sabba, by the side of the Aqua Appia, in the same tunnel,
but in a terra-cotta pipe, not in the stone _specus_. The third branch,
in the direction of the Colosseum, may still be in use, though so deep as
to be unknown, supplying wells only, and this may be the one tapped by
the workmen employed by Signor Rosa, and which now floods the Colosseum,
and S. Clement’s also. The only outlet from a large reservoir, in which
the water is always three feet deep, must afford a very abundant supply
of water, and the account given by the workmen who made this branch of
it agrees with this. They say it was a steady constant stream of water,
and it did not gush out of the earth in the manner that a natural spring
does; the spring must therefore be at some distance. If this view is
correct, it would be comparatively easy to turn the stream into a drain
under the Clivus Scauri, and into the one made by the Municipality about
1865, under the road near the church of S. Gregory, between the Cœlian
and the Palatine, and to carry it in that manner to the Tiber.

It is however probable that this spring alone, which was only a
subsidiary spring to the Appian aqueduct, is not sufficiently abundant
to supply the quantity of water, which now rises to the height of about
ten feet, or quite three metres, in the substructures of the Colosseum.
There is another spring, or perhaps more than one, in the ancient stone
quarry under the garden of the monks of SS. John and Paul, on the other
side of the Clivus Scauri, on the site of the Claudium, or that square
part of the Cœlian Hill which is nearest to the Colosseum. This site is
marked on an old plan of Rome, of the sixteenth century, as a reservoir
of water, and there are no less than ten wells that descend into this
old stone quarry. In the eighteenth century, and down to the middle of
the nineteenth, this was called a _vivarium_, and was supposed to be the
place where the wild animals were kept for exhibitions in the Colosseum,
but there is no visible communication from one to the other. A plan of
the old quarry, which was made for this work some years since, shews that
this was not a _vivarium_. There are three ponds, but perhaps only one
spring of water in it, and if the outlet for this water was stopped, the
whole of the quarry, or caves as they are called, would soon be full of
water. It seems probable that this is the place from which the greater
part of the water comes that floods both the Colosseum and the cave of
Mithras, nearly under the church of S. Clement. It seems also quite
practicable to remove the water by an iron pipe into the drain under
the road between the Cœlian and the Palatine, made by the Municipality
about 1866. The level of the quarry is eight metres above that of the
Colosseum; the soil there is on the level of the arena, and that is
seven metres above the original pavement; the water in the old quarry
is therefore fifteen metres, or about 45 ft. above the level of the old
drain of the Colosseum, and nearly six metres above the drain made by the
Municipality.

This opportunity may be taken to say, that great credit is due to the
Municipality of Rome for the energy and perseverance with which they have
carried on an admirable system of new drainage for the city; and not
only the new city on the hills on the site of the city of the Kings and
of the Empire, but also of the modern city of the Popes, built in the
swamp between the hills and the Tiber, the draining of which is by no
means easy. Nothing can be better than the old Cloaca Maxima, which is
still the chief drain to this part of Rome, or for that of part of the
old city; it drains the water of the streams that run down from three
hills, the Palatine, the Capitoline, and the Quirinal, on this side. But
on the northern side of the Capitoline Hill, in which was the Campus
Martius, the mediæval drains are by no means equally good with those of
the Kings; the mouths of these drains are always open to the Tiber, and
when there is a flood of the river the water runs up the drains, and the
Pantheon, which stands on very low ground, is always the first place in
Rome to be flooded. Surely a sluice-gate might be placed at the mouth of
each drain, suspended from a bar at the top, and worked on pivots only,
which would let the water out, but would not let any in, as in the common
_traps_ of a drain in daily use in England.

The Roman authorities say that the water of the Tiber would close the
doors, and not let any of the water in the drain pass out, but if the
door was placed obliquely, and let the water flow past it with as little
pressure upon it as possible, the water in the drains, which runs rapidly
and with considerable force, would very soon force open the door that was
suspended at the mouth of it. Any embankment of the Tiber would be money
thrown away; if the great engineers and architects who built the wall of
Aurelian, could not make it secure on the bank of the Tiber, no modern
engineers or architects will do so. We see that nearly the whole of the
great wall of Aurelian, on the bank of the Tiber, has been swept away by
the great floods; the substructures of the towers, under water, remain,
and are visible when the water is low in the river, but all along the
bank has been swept away. When the water rises at the rate of a foot in
an hour, and continues to do so for twenty hours consecutively, and runs
at the rate of nine or ten miles an hour, no wall can stand against it
that offers any resistance to it; smooth walls parallel to the course of
the river might stand, as the quay of the Ripa Grande does, because it
offers no resistance to the water.

After the greater part of this chapter was written and in type, I
thought it necessary to go to Capua and Pozzuoli again to examine the
remains of these amphitheatres, and I did so in November, 1875; it was
my intention at the same time to have gone to Pompeii, to examine the
amphitheatre there also, but the weather was so bad at that time I found
it quite impracticable to do so; I therefore did so in May, 1876, and
I find that the amphitheatre at Pompeii is of the time of Sylla the
Dictator, and that the arrangements are not the same as those of the
Roman amphitheatre; there are no substructions under the arena, and it
appears there never could have been any, as in the centre there is the
top of an original well, and the floor seems always to have been of earth
only; there are no preparations for _Naumachia_, and the dens for the
wild beasts are on the same level as the arena, and behind the _podium_.
In the principal entrances there are sockets for a wooden balustrade,
to separate the people from the wild beasts. The corridor round at the
back of these dens has the original walls of brickwork, of good hard
bricks, but rather thick, somewhat similar to those of the Pantheon at
Rome, but much thicker than those of the time of Nero; the brick vaults
of this corridor, or passage under the lower gallery, are modern or
mediæval repairs. Many of the seats have been preserved or restored, they
are of stone of volcanic character, the stone of the country, in fact,
but they are of a convenient height, and comfortable to sit upon, though
closely packed; the seat is raised two or three inches above the place
for the feet of those in the next seat above. The construction of the
outer wall is of blocks of lava, about the shape of English bricks, but
rather larger, and with _opus reticulatum_, the pattern of large size,
enclosed in a sort of framework of these quasi-bricks, very similar to
the Muro Torto at Rome. The fresco of the first century found on a wall
here, and now preserved in the Museum at Naples[243], is a caricature
of the building; and the _vomitoria_, which form a conspicuous object
in the front of the picture, are greatly exaggerated, made much more
lofty and more long and narrow than they really are. They are said to
be the ladies’ entrance to their gallery, which was the upper gallery
at the back; but as the slope was very gradual, and the building not
nearly so high as the Colosseum, they would be able to see perfectly
well, and their entrance and exit being entirely on the exterior of
the building, while that of the men was from the interior, was a very
convenient arrangement. It seems probable that Scaurus, the step-on of
Sylla, had seen this building in progress, and as the Romans always had
the idea of making Rome the most magnificent city in the world, he built
the far more magnificent amphitheatre in Rome; but as the upper part was
built of wood, though magnificently decorated with columns of marble,
of glass, and of gilt wood, as we have said, it seems to have offended
the Republican notions of the Romans, and this upper part was entirely
destroyed, or this may have happened from an accidental fire; but as the
substructures were of tufa they were everlasting, as Pliny says, and
they still remain as the principal foundations of the Colosseum, with
brick walls and galleries erected upon them in the time of Nero, and the
whole enclosed by the magnificent stone front and double corridors of the
Flavian Emperors.

EXTERIOR, FROM THE THERMÆ OF TITUS.

This view shews the only part that is at all perfect of the magnificent
work of the Flavian Emperors, consisting of the grand front and the
splendid corridors, built around the brick theatre of Nero, with the
galleries for spectators, which are surrounded by these stone corridors.
These are of the best building stone to be had in Rome,—the travertine
from the quarries near Tibur, now Tivoli.

The front had evidently been left unfinished by Nero, as we find no
traces of any brick front according to the fashion of his time, when the
brickwork was the finest that the world has ever seen.

It will be observed that the lower part of the ground-floor is concealed
in the view by the bank of earth on which the modern road is carried, and
the parapet wall of that road. It will also be observed that each storey
is different; the lower storeys have different orders of architecture,
but with scarcely any difference of plan or of construction, whereas the
upper storey is quite different from the rest. There are no arches in it,
but flat pilasters instead of columns, small square windows, and a row of
corbels projecting boldly from the wall, and a prominent cornice over it.
These corbels were for the purpose of carrying the feet of the masts that
supported the awning over the heads of the spectators in the galleries,
and these masts passed through holes left for them in the cornice, as
will be seen more plainly in Plate XII.

This upper storey is more than a century later in date than the lower
parts of the building; it replaces a wooden gallery for the common
people, which had been made upon the top of the great corridors, which
was too tempting a place for the purpose to be lost, although this wooden
gallery does not appear to have formed part of the original design,—to
judge from the representations of the building on the coins, which are
probably made from the designs of the architects before the work was
executed. There are six designs extant on the coins, and no two of them
are exactly alike, especially for this upper storey[244].

SUPERSTRUCTURE.

VIEWS OF PARTS OF THE BUILDING.

A. The upper view is taken from the top gallery looking down, and
shewing the ruins of the lower brick galleries, with the windows of the
corridors. Behind the wall in which these windows are placed is seen
part of one of the corridors without its roof or vault, but with the
steps of one of the _vomitoria_, and at the back of that the arches can
be seen of the outer corridor; for it must be remembered that there was
a _double_ corridor all round this enormous fabric. The object of this
was to facilitate ingress and egress from the rest of the building, and
the galleries were divided into many distinct parts, each with its own
passages and steps, so that there would be no more confusion or pressure
in emptying this enormous building than from the emptying of an ordinary
room that would hold fifty people. In the upper part of this view, on the
right hand, is seen in the distance the church of S. Stefano Rotondo and
the trees on the Cœlian Hill.

B. The lower view is taken from the inner side of the chief gallery on
the first floor, looking outwards, through one of the arches of the
corridor. In this particular compartment was one of the reservoirs of
water supplied by the aqueducts. The evidence for this is seen on the
right-hand side of the picture, where the lower part of a _specus_ or
channel for the water remains, with some of the peculiar cement used only
for the aqueducts, against the wall and lining the _specus_.

Half way along this brick wall is seen a part of one of the narrow piers
of travertine which go from the top to the bottom of the building, to
carry the upper gallery at that enormous height, as the engineers were
afraid to trust the soft tufa wall with the facing of brick. A little
further on the right is seen the opening between the brick wall of the
gallery and the stone wall of the corridor; the light is seen shining
through the opening, which is here about three inches wide, and there is
no bonding anywhere between the brick wall of the gallery and the stone
wall of the corridor. Towards the south end of the building on this
level, in at least two instances, the stone piers have been carried away
for building materials, and the lower part of the brick wall, through
which it had been cut, stands just as well without it as with it. The
object of this tall stone pier was to carry the upper gallery only, not
to support the old walls of the lower galleries[245].

period, helps to explain what follows, but the excavations at that time
were only carried to the depth of ten feet, and the original pavement was
found only (in 1874) at the depth of twenty-one feet from the foot of the
_podium_, which is on the ordinary level of the soil. Consequently, we
only have here visible the surface, with the central passage and the two
canals on each side of it, and the side passage round the edge just under
the _podium_. The square openings for the lifts for men and dogs are seen
on each side of the central passage. The ruins of the brick galleries are
also seen much as they remain now.

The view is taken from above, at the north end. It is singular that the
engineers at that time did not see that they had excavated the tops of
arches of which the lower parts were still buried, yet the same thing
is clearly seen in the excellent set of drawings made for the French
Government at the time, and now preserved in the British Museum. In these
all the details are given with exact measurements, and yet they appear
not to have seen that they had excavated the tops of a series of arches
and left the rest buried.

INTERIOR, AT THE SOUTH-EAST END. VIEW IN THE PASSAGES.

In the centre of the view, at the foot, are seen the boards for the
wheelbarrows of the workmen, leaning against the top of the arch of the
great subterranean drain to carry off the water when it was let off with
a rush after the naval fights. Under the boards are remains of an ancient
iron grating, to prevent any object being carried off into the drain
by the force of the water. On each side of these boards are traces of
the flood-gate, by which the water could be stopped, or the rate of it
regulated.

Beyond this, on each side, is a wide arch of stone parallel to the great
central passage. These arches open into two large and lofty vaulted
chambers of considerable length, passing under the galleries. In the
pavement of the floor in each of these is a line of seven sockets for
pivots to work in, some of which retain the bronze socket, in others it
has been torn out.

Between the two great round-headed arches is seen a square-topped opening
at the end of a long passage over the great drain. This was the passage
for the animals that were brought through it in their cages, excepting
the elephants, which were led into the large dens provided for them, two
on each side of the passage further on.

Above this was the state entrance from the south towards S. Clement’s and
the Lateran, and on each side are the ruins of the galleries as before.

INTERIOR, TOWARDS THE SOUTH-WEST, WITH THE SUBSTRUCTURES IN 1874.

Immediately to the right, and nearly in the centre of the picture, is
seen the earth not then excavated when this view was taken. In front of
this, as shewn to the right of the picture, is one of the ancient walls
of tufa faced with brick, which carries on its right-hand side one of
the canals of water. To the left of the view, close under the _podium_,
is seen another wall of tufa, but cut, and with vertical grooves clearly
seen in it; these were for the lifts. Behind this are the arches of the
dens of the wild beasts, under the path in front of the _podium_; then
the _podium_ itself, with square recesses in it, usually said to have
been for men to take refuge in, should the animals be able to spring
over the net-work in front; but this is not probable, when we see the
precautions taken: they were more likely for the athletes, or for the
attendants or guards under the state gallery. Behind this are the ruins
of the galleries and the windows of the corridors, as before.

In this view the grooves in the walls are clearly seen on both sides of
the passage between them, and the arches of the dens behind the outer
wall. The lions, or other wild animals about that size, passed from the
dens through an opening in the wall into the cages provided for them in
this passage. The cages were placed upon lifts, and when the word was
given by the emperor, were all pulled up at once to the arena, or floor
of boards, with trap-doors in it all along over this passage. We are told
by Herodian (as has been shewn in the text, p. 26) that on one occasion
a hundred lions leaped on to the stage or arena at the same time, and
appeared to the spectators in the gallery to “leap out of the earth;” the
sand with which the floor was covered over would have that appearance
when the trap-doors, and lifts, and the tops of the cages along with
them, were opened from below. In the passage is a long series (one behind
the place for each cage and lift) of sockets seen in the pavement,
apparently each for a capstan to wind the twenty-one feet of cord upon,
when the cage was pulled up to the top, and the trap-doors opened.

This plate is from an excellent drawing of Signor Cicconetti, made
chiefly from the photographs, in order to explain them more clearly. The
photographs are evidence of historical facts, which no drawing alone
can be, because drawings are always liable to errors, accidentally or
otherwise. Unfortunately drawings are very often made to suit the idea
either of the artist who draws the object as he thinks “it must have
been,” or to suit the view of the person who orders the drawing. These
drawings can be compared with the photographs throughout, and make them
more easy to understand.

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE IX.

1. ARCH OF THE SECOND CENTURY IN THE SUBSTRUCTURE.

In addition to the two ancient walls of tufa parallel to each other round
the edge, with the grooves for lifts in them, there are some remains
here and there of a third wall of tufa within the other two, and this
appears to have been much shaken by an earthquake. In this, little is
perfect, but in the parts that remain there are arches, and these arches
are supported by brick walls of different periods. The upper arch in this
plate is supported by a brick wall of the second century, as is seen by
the thickness and quality of the bricks and of the mortar between them.
This is shewn by the six-foot rule, each foot painted alternately black
and white, by which the bricks can be counted the same as on the spot.

2. ARCH OF THE FIRST CENTURY IN THE SAME.

This small arch is in the same wall, but in this case the brick arch that
supports the tufa is clearly of the time of Nero[246]. The long, thin
bricks of his time, nine or ten to the foot, are well known to all Roman
archæologists, and are so marked that there is no mistaking them: they
are thus good evidence that the amphitheatre of Nero, mentioned by Pliny,
was on the same site as the Flavian Amphitheatre. A segment of another
arch of the same period abuts against it, to support it like a flying
buttress, and is seen in the plate.

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE X.

SUBSTRUCTURES.

REMAINS OF TWO CANALS, ONE SUPPORTED ON TIMBERS, THE OTHER ON BRICK
ARCHES.

These two canals, parallel to each other, to be supplied with water by
the aqueducts, and used for the _naumachia_ or naval fights, are among
the most curious discoveries brought to light in the recent explorations.
They shew how completely the whole of the great public exhibitions of the
ancient Romans were theatrical displays, with all the usual tricks of a
theatre, just the same as in a Christmas pantomime.

This shews also that _stagna_ do not necessarily mean ponds; any
reservoir of water is a _stagnum_, whether supplied by a natural spring
or by an aqueduct. Neither of these now remaining are of the time
of Nero, they belong to later repairs or alterations; but the great
thickness and strength of the wall of so little height could only have
been made to support the weight of water. This is especially evident
in the upper view, where the wall is nearly as thick as it is high. In
this passage the canal, lined with lead, was supported on massive wooden
beams; in the lower view the canal in that passage, which is wider than
the other, was supported on the brick arches of the second or third
century, shewn in this view.

It is even probable that the _stagna_ of Nero were in the same place as
these, as a good deal of brickwork of his time is on a higher level than
these walls, and the two sheets of water, one on either side of the great
central passage, would have been magnificent sheets of water, about three
hundred feet long and fifty or sixty or more wide in the central part,
though narrow at both ends. It is still possible, though not probable,
that the _stagna_ of Nero were on a lower level, cut through a bed of
tufa, which is not generally very thick, to the clay of the Tiber valley
beneath. This would account for the central passages on the site of the
_stagna_ having suffered so much from the earthquakes, while the great
corridors of the Flavian Emperors, standing on the bed of tufa, have not
suffered at all.

TWO CAPITALS.

A. FROM THE UPPER STOREY.

B. FROM THE LOWER ONE, OR THE PODIUM.

It will be seen at once that this capital (A) is intentionally left in
a rude state to be seen from a distance[247], the upper gallery being
nearly a hundred feet above the level of the arena. A great number of
these capitals, and of the white marble columns to which they belonged,
have rolled down from the top of the building to the bottom in an
earthquake, crushing all the seats of the galleries in their fall; as
many as forty of them have been found, and a still larger number of
broken columns, which have evidently fallen with great force; some of
them have been found passing quite through the walls in the substructure,
and can be still seen with one end on one side of the wall, and the other
on the opposite side.

B. is a highly-finished capital of the Corinthian order: of this kind
only three or four have been found, but much more perfect than most of
the others. They were probably on the short columns of the _podium_ by
the side of the state entrance.

they are cut down from two feet to three or four inches at the impost, or
springing of each arch, just where the greatest strength would have been
required. They have evidently been cut through to admit the stone piers,
which were required to carry the upper gallery, when that was built of
stone instead of wood.

B. Athletes.—On this fragment of marble the drawing is very indistinct,
but there appear to be two figures only, with arms in their hands,
and their heads bare, their helmets being on a table behind them.
Inscriptions are scratched upon these, which are rather difficult to make
out, but seem to be—on one, IVTOR (?); on another, LIMENI NIKÆ; on a
third, OVIM. The rest are too indistinct to be read.

C. A hunt of wild beasts.—This is extremely curious, but not very
distinct in the original, and therefore not in the photo-engraving, which
admits of no _restorations_. There are five animals all of the same kind,
but what animal they are intended for it is not easy to say; they have
claws, the heads look like wolves’. Each has a broken cord hanging to its
neck. There are two huntsmen with spears in their hands running after
them; they are clothed in tight dresses, with bands round the waist and
the knees, and with buskins on their feet.

GRAFFITO OF THE PODIUM, &c.

This is one of the four _graffiti_ found during the excavations in 1874.
It represents the front of the _podium_, with the framework for the
netting to protect the spectators in the lower gallery, or state-gallery,
from the wild beasts, if they should attempt to spring up into it when
hunted on the stage or arena below, at the foot of the _podium_. This
fragment shews the lower portion of the screen, which is recorded to have
had a bar at the top that turned round, so that if any animal tried to
cling to it he would fall backwards on the arena. This was level with
the foot of the _podium_, and twenty-one feet above the pavement at the
bottom, on the level of the dens for the wild beasts, and the floor of
the passage between the two walls of tufa, with vertical grooves in them
for the lifts, with the cages upon them. Behind the place for each cage
in the paved floor of the passage, is a socket for a pivot to work in,
at the foot of a capstan or post, to wind the twenty-one feet of cord
upon, with the lift, when pulled up to the trap-door of the arena. This
pavement is represented as resting on the top of a series of arches with
bars across; these are probably intended for the doors of the wild beasts
below, but rudely represented, and with some sort of performance going on
in front.

This is drawn from a restoration made by M. Viollet-le-Duc for Napoleon
III. at Compiègne. It illustrates in a very remarkable manner the cradle
found in the Colosseum, with the struts on each side. As this cradle was
made from the best authorities long before the finding of the cradle in
the Colosseum, it is particularly valuable for the purpose of comparison.

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXVII.

AMPHITHEATRE OR COLOSSEUM AT CAPUA.

_This Plate is a reproduction of Photograph with no attempt at
restoration._

The resemblance between this and the Colosseum in Rome is so remarkable,
that there can be no doubt one is a copy from the other. In this
amphitheatre the two canals for water, on each side of the great central
passage, and the curved passage round the outer edge, are distinctly
visible. At Capua, the aqueduct for the water, and the drain to carry it
off, remain.

AMPHITHEATRE AT POMPEII, FROM A FRESCO PAINTING.

The lower view is from a fresco at Pompeii. It shews the awning is drawn
off behind. There is a front built out distinct from the oval building,
with which it is connected by a curved wall at each end, and on which
is a passage with persons upon it; there are two grand flights of steps
leading up to the top, and persons going up them. These steps are carried
on arches, increasing in height as they get nearer the top. The front
passage is also carried on tall arches. All these arrangements for the
entrance and exit seem to be a bad substitute for the _vomitoria_ of the
Roman Colosseum.

There appears to be another place of amusement of some kind by the side
of the amphitheatre. A square space enclosed by a high wall, with two
arches on one side or doorways (?), probably a school for gladiators,
with an _impluvium_ in the middle. There is an inscription on the wall,
of which all that is legible is DIVCRET ...; there is also in the front
of the picture a tent with persons under it, and two small square or
oblong huts, evidently of wood, the planks being shewn in one with a
door; this was probably a wine-shop.

There are a number of figures in active motion in all parts of the
picture, many of them evidently fighting, and it represents a skirmish
between the Nucerini and the Pompeiani; the inhabitants of a neighbouring
town, called Nuceria or Nocera, having made a sudden inroad on Pompeii,
the Pompeians are flying in all directions, closely followed, some dying
and some dead. These hand-to-hand fights are seen on the arena, in
the corridors or _ambulatories_, on the walls of the town, and on the
esplanade round the building, which is planted with trees for shade[253].

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXXII.

THE AMPHITHEATRE AT POZZUOLI, NEAR NAPLES.

In this instance the arena has fortunately been preserved, with the
trap-doors in it; those round the edge being for wild beasts, the others
for men and dogs, and the central passage as in the _Colosseum_. We see
that the central passage has been boarded over also. The arrangement of
the seats in the galleries is also the same, and the tufa wall behind
probably indicates that there was an awning over the galleries in the
same manner. This confirms one part of the history of the Colosseum,
and the Amphitheatre at Capua confirms another part, the canals for
the _naumachia_ or naval battles, although these were evidently very
different from what had formerly been supposed. At each end of the
part that is uncovered of the central passage it will be observed that
there is a short post, looking very much like a capstan for winding a
cord upon, as in Rome, although in this instance they are square and
on the surface, and not on the pavement below. Each of the openings to
the trap-doors has a groove round it, for a cover to fit into; possibly
this was made water-tight, so that the whole surface could be flooded.
The central passage has the same sort of groove sunk round it. The same
arrangement may have been used in the Colosseum, but in that case there
is the difficulty of the interval between the _podium_ of the lower
gallery and the floor of the arena, which does not appear to have existed
at Pozzuoli. This would have made it impracticable to flood the whole
surface at Rome, which might have been done at Pozzuoli.

It is here impossible that they could have fallen down in an earthquake,

and these decorations were removed from the surface, as interfering with
the cultivation of the garden, and thrown down into the substructures,
and then arranged under the vault as we see them.

[45] Every square yard of this part of Rome has been trenched in the
search for statues in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and
records of these numerous excavations are carefully preserved in the
Miscellanea of Fea. Had there been any such building as would be required
for this purpose anywhere near his palace, it must have come to light,
and nothing of the kind has been found.

[46] See Plate II.

[47] The basin of Nero was possibly cut through the layer of tufa,
which underlies the whole soil of Rome, down to the clay under it. In
some excavations made under my direction in a cave under the Aventine,
near the Marmorata, which was the mouth of the Aqua Appia, a level bed
of white clay was found under the tufa rock of which the Aventine Hill
consists; this would account for the walls in the central part built
of concrete and brick, on this clay foundation, having been frequently
damaged by earthquakes, while the great stone arcades, being built upon
the tufa rock, did not suffer from the shocks. Clay is always a bad
foundation to build upon, and there are always settlements in buildings
that rest upon it. The objection to this theory is, that the surface of
the water would be twenty-one feet below the arena and the foot of the
_podium_.

[48] See Plate IX.

[49] In the ancient catalogue of the Emperors and their works, known
as “Catalogus Viennensis Imp. Rom. apud Eccard.,” under Vespasian, it
is stated that he dedicated the first three steps of the amphitheatre,
implying that three were already finished even in his time.

[A.D. 70.] “Hic prior tribus gradibus amphitheatrum dedicavit;”

That Titus added two more.

[A.D. 81.] “Hic amphitheatrum a tribus gradibus patris sui dura adjecit.”

And further, that Domitian completed the building up to the clypea, that
is, the top cornice at that time, when the upper storey was of wood.

[A.D. 92-96.] “Domitianus Imp. ... Amphitheatrum usque ad clypea.”

[69] Santi-Bartoli (in a paper printed in the _Miscellanea_, by Fea, vol.
i. p. ccxxiii.) states that in his time a quantity of leaden water-pipes,
which carried water from the Thermæ of Titus to the Colosseum, were found
in an orchard north of the Colosseum.

[70] Suetonii Nero, c. 12.

[71] This dedication is referred to by Eutropius thus,—

“Hic [Titus] amphitheatrum Romæ ædificavit, et in dedicatione ejus
quinque millia ferarum occidit.” (Eutropius, lib. vii. c. 14. See also
Cassiodorus, Variar. l. v. op. 42. Opera omnia, ed. 1679, fol. vol. i. p.
94, c. 2.)

The account by Suetonius, writing some eighty or ninety years previously,
is very clear:—

“Amphitheatro dedicato, thermisque juxta celeriter exstructis, munus
edidit apparatissimum largissimumque. Dedit et navale prœlium in veteri
naumachia: ibidem et gladiatores: atque uno die quinque millia omne genus
ferarum.” (Suetonius Titus, c. 7.)

These old _naumachia_ were the same as the _stagnum navale_, the old
place for such amusements on the spot. They have been supposed to be the
Naumachia of Augustus in the Trastevere, but without authority; and the
mention of the gladiators in connection with them implies that it was at
the same place.

[76] It is important to notice this, because some able architects did
not see it at first sight, and imagined that these brick arches rested
upon the stone piers, which was evidently not really the case, though it
appears to be so.

M. Viollet-le-Duc, one of the most eminent architects of our time, says
that an experienced architect would cut through old tufa walls of this
kind as easily, and with as little scruple, as he would cut through
cheese, and the brick facing made no material difference.

[77] “... item stagnum maris instar, circumseptum ædificiis ad urbium

the fifth or sixth century has been introduced between the two old tufa
walls, during the repairs after the earthquakes. This is at first sight
rather puzzling, until it is examined and properly considered.

[89] This _vivarium_ is a triangular piece of ground, the wide end
of which touches the wall of the Amphitheatrum Castrense; the narrow
end is only just wide enough for the body of a man to pass through an
aperture made in it, as the ground is between a wall of Aurelian on the
inner side, and a wall of the Sessorium on the outer side, preserved by
Aurelian as an outwork. This was the scene of the celebrated ambuscade of
Belisarius, by means of which the Goths were driven away from Rome, as
described by Procopius (De Bello Gothico, lib. i. c. 22.)

[99] Those English people who remember Sadler’s Wells Theatre in London
about 1820, must know that there was always a sheet of water or reservoir
under the stage, and trap-doors in the floor by which sea-monsters could
be introduced. The amusements of the old Roman people seem to have been
frequently of this kind. Naval fights in boats might have been performed
in the Colosseum, and a great deal of machinery must have been required
to remove the floor and replace it.

A wooden Roman bridge still remains under water near Compiègne in France,
of which M. Peigné Delacourt has published an account, with engravings
of it, so that wood under water is preserved in the same manner as when
it is buried in a wet soil. This is well known in the case of piles for
bridges, and in those under the city of Amsterdam.

[100] See Plate XXVI.

[101] It appears evident from the inscriptions from the College of
the Arvales that the seats were regularly and permanently allotted to
different persons holding different offices, according to their rank. The
lower seats being of marble, the upper ones of wood.

There are many inscriptions relating to the seats in the different
theatres and amphitheatres in Rome:

[105] One series of these corbels in the upper corridor seems to have
been for a wooden gallery, for the use of the sailors going to furl or
unfurl the awning.

[106] Some clamps of the same form were found, in 1870, in the interior
of the wall of Servius Tullius, (in the part destroyed for the railway,)
where the stones were joined together by them.

[111] These views of buildings on coins appear to have been made from
the architect’s designs before they were carried out, and were sometimes

[123] Calpurnius has usually been considered as a writer of the third
century, but the most recent editor of his Eclogues (Haupt) shews that he
was contemporary with Nero and Titus, and Dean Merivale is of the same
opinion.

The space enclosed within the outer walls is six acres, and there is an
extraordinary difference of climate between the northern and the southern
side. Dr. Deakin published a work on the Flora of the Colosseum: he found
423 _species_ of plants, belonging to 253 _genera_.

Over the door now generally used is a painting of the heavenly Jerusalem
and the Crucifixion, of the time of Paul III., A.D. 1534-50, in the style
of the older pilgrimage pictures. At the time it was painted the passage
appears to have been filled up with earth to such a height as to make the
picture a conspicuous object in leaving the building; at present it is
quite above the heads of the passers-by, and is seldom noticed or seen.

[151] The interior of the building is still grand in its ruins. This is
well shewn in the photograph (No. 1195,) with the cross, and the altar,
and the stations erected by the pope about 1750, and destroyed in 1874,
in order to excavate the whole of the area. A restoration of the interior
according to Canina can also be seen in another photograph (No. 724).

The fine set of drawings made for the French Government at that period
are now preserved in the British Museum, and fully bear out what I
had stated before I had seen them. They clearly shew that the French
excavations were not carried down more than ten feet. The tops of
the arches of the lower passage are shewn in the drawings, but these
excavations appear to have been stopped by water rising to that height.

[153] See No. 1742, and Plate III.

[154] Probably the aqueduct which passes there had a hole made in it; the
same aqueduct goes on from this side of the building to the south-east
end. This occurred again in 1874, and a steam engine had again to be
employed. This passage, before it turns, goes in the direction of the
_castellum aquæ_ of the time of Alexander Severus, of which there are
considerable remains between this point and the Cœlian. The _specus_
of an aqueduct of the same period passes along between the Cœlian and
the amphitheatre, near the surface of the ground; a portion of this was
visible in 1874.

[155] See Photograph, No. 367.

[156] See p. 5.

[157] In the summer of 1875 they were again suspended for want of funds
to pay for the steam-engine, which costs a pound a-day.

[161] About the year 1865 a new drain was made by the Municipality under
that road, and when it was nearly finished the old drain of the Empire
(?), or of the time of Sylla (?), was found under it at a considerably
lower level. It is fifteen metres below the surface of the ground, and
so much filled up with earth that it is considered (in 1876) quite
impracticable to have it cleared out and repaired.

[169] Some scholars say that those scenes could not have taken place on
this site, because the Flavian Amphitheatre was not built in the time of
Nero. But it has been shewn that an awning in the _amphitheatre of Nero_
is described by Pliny, writing at the time, during the life and reign
of Nero, as he uses the expression _principis Neronis_, which he could
hardly have used after his death. No other site but this can be found
for such a large building as an amphitheatre, and this is close to the
Golden House of Nero. In any case athletes or wrestlers, and _naumachia_
or naval fights, are part of the tradition of many Roman amphitheatres,
and there are sufficient remains of the substructures in many places
to prove that this tradition is well founded. The _corridors_ of the
Flavian Emperors, though splendid additions to this great theatre, were
not _necessary_ for the performance of those pantomimes. It has also been
shewn that the old tufa walls _must be_ earlier than the time of Nero,
and are probably of the time of Sylla.

[170] See Plates IV. to X.

[171] They were made at the suggestion of the author of this work,
rather sooner than would otherwise have been the case, in order that
he might be able to see them. Signor Rosa unfortunately began pulling
down the walls of the substructure, calling them “Frangipani walls.” The
Frangipani family had possession of the Colosseum in the twelfth century,
but the construction of that period is totally different from any of the
walls in the Colosseum, either above or below the level of the _arena_.
The Minister of Public Instruction fortunately arrived in Rome in time
to stop their demolition, and obtained an Act of Parliament, in 1875,
appointing a general Archæological Commission for all Italy, with Signor
Fiorelli, from Pompeii, at the head of it; and no individual will in
future be permitted either to destroy antiquities, or to build anything
new, without the consent of the Commission.

[176] The plan of one section of this enormous building (see No. 183 and
Plate XIV.), and those of the six different floors or storeys, shew the
admirable arrangement of the seats and passages, and _vomitoria_ for
the rapid exit of the people, as well as the plan of the whole building
would do. The magnificent stone arcades of the Flavian Emperors, A.D. 80,
appear in many parts to be built against brick walls and galleries of the
time of Nero, originally built for the spectators of the old Naumachia.
(See No. 3205, 1762.)

[177] The amphitheatre is 1,837 Roman feet in circuit, 638 long,
535 wide, and 165 high from the ground, besides 21 feet for the
substructures, so that the whole height was 186 feet. The Roman foot is
not quite so long as the English foot, but the difference is trifling.
The number of spectators was 87,000 according to the Regionary Catalogue;
modern authorities say that the measurement shews this number to be
rather exaggerated.

stone was scarce, they were frequently of wood only.

[192] See pp. 1, 8. That the amphitheatres were among the finest
buildings of the Romans in all their cities it is hardly necessary
to say; it seems clear that they were first built for the favourite
amusement of the hunting of wild beasts, and that the first name for
them was _Theatrum Venatorium_; but the gladiators were soon introduced,
for the further amusement of the people in the same buildings. Both
amusements are believed to have been used in Greece before they were
introduced into Rome, but they were in use in Rome before the time of the
Empire. At first, the amphitheatres were temporary buildings of wood only
(as has been shewn), but there were several of these. After the great
Flavian amphitheatre was completed, this seems to have been the only one
in Rome; but those of several other cities, such as Capua and Verona (see
the learned work of Scipio Maffei, _Verona Illustrata_, Milano, 1876,
parte quarta) must have been nearly equal to it.

[193] The following inscriptions, found upon the spot, agree with
the construction, as is always the case when the true date can be
ascertained. The first is of the time of Hadrian, A.D. 120, (No. 43
in chapter vii. of the work of Francesco Alvino, which contains the
ancient inscriptions found upon the spot); the second (No. 48 of the
same collection) appears to be of Septimius Severus and Pertinax, A.D.
192; the third in point of date (No. 16 in the collection) records
restorations by Lampridius:—

By a singular coincidence, Lampadius was also the name of the Prefect who
restored the Flavian amphitheatre in A.D. 445; but though the surname is
the same, the prename is not, he was probably of the same family.

[194] See p. 45.

[195] This would be at least equal to £200 of modern money.

[197] The Neapolitan _palm_ is ten inches English measure. If the
measurements of Signor Alvino are reduced to English measure, they do not
agree with those of Messrs. Taylor and Crecy for the Colosseum; as he
used the same scale for all three, the proportions are the same.

[198] In Rome these are Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Composite; at Verona,
all Tuscan; at Capua, all Doric.

[199] I am indebted for this clear account of the amphitheatre at Pola to
Lord Talbot de Malahide, who was there in October, 1875. The excellent
drawings of Mr. Arthur Glennie, who resided at Pola for one whole summer,
also agree perfectly with the excellent account of that remarkable
building, which further contributes to illustrate the Colosseum at
Rome. An excellent account of Pola appeared about the same time in the
_Saturday Review_, but this is more general, not so specially written
with this object in view.

                        (Martialis de Spect. Ep. 28.)

That is, the _stagna_ in the amphitheatre were supplied by an aqueduct
from the lake of Fucino. This lake has been drained in 1874-75 by Prince
Torlonia, by carrying out the project of the great engineers of the time
of the Emperor Claudius, and making an _emisarium_, on even a grander
scale than the one partially made in the time of Claudius, on a similar
plan to those of the lakes of Albano and Nemi.

Contra est: quidquid ante pugnatum est, misericordia fuit. Nunc omissis

A similar mania has sometimes been heard of in recent times in Paris and
in London.

[238] Friedländer says that a compact floor of glass was found at Veii
(vol. iii. p. 103).

[239] This remarkably fine pavement is still preserved (1876) at
Præneste, now called Palestrina.

[246] The photo-engraver has unfortunately turned this photograph upside
down, but it is not of much consequence, as the size and thickness of the
bricks of Nero can be seen just the same. The space is so narrow that it
was difficult to get a photograph of it at all; but this is just one of
the cases in which a photograph is of great importance, because there
is nothing in which artists are so careless as in the thickness of the
bricks and of the mortar between them; there is nothing in which it would
be more easy to play tricks, if they wished to do so.

[247] The fragment of sculpture placed upon this capital has nothing to
do with it, being merely placed there by the workmen, but a photograph
necessarily reproduces things exactly as they were found at the time the
photograph was taken.

[248] The piers of tufa are represented as transparent, to shew the
insertion of the consoles in them. This insertion, with the irregularity
of the plan of the tufa piers, contrasted with the mathematical accuracy
of the work of the Flavian Emperors, proves that they belonged to an
earlier building.

[249] In other instances, the brick arches of construction appear to rest
on the piers of travertine between them; but as these have been removed,
and the brick walls stand equally well without them, it is evident that
this is not the case. The tall piers of travertine reach the whole height
of the building, to support the upper gallery. In the following plate
the same remarkable construction is shewn more clearly, because in this
instance the aperture left by the removal of the stone piers is visible
in two storeys, and it is seen that three piers extended from the upper
gallery to the ground, passing through all the other storeys.

in the British Museum.
